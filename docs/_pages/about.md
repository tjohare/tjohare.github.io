Husband, Stepfather, Uncle, Photographer, and Engineer; When I'm not running around the neighborhood chasing my dogs, you can find me out on the town or traveling the world with my wife, usually with camera in hand.

Thankfully my wife is my best friend and we go everywhere together and try to see everything while we can still enjoy it.

We typically like to adventure out and go hiking / exploring around an area, where both of us have
camera to capture what we see.   Sometimes the different perspective is important.
