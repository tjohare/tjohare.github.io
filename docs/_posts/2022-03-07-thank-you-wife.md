I know it's fairly clich√©, but she really is my best friend.  And she saved my life.  Literally.

So a week after my 50th birthday, on Dec 24th 2020, I had a severe type-A aortic dissection.  You can check out the story I wrote on my [Facebook post][facebook-post].  My actual chances of surviving that were not good, but I did.   

But we're not letting that slow us down.   And honestly, we've had the best time running around Europe and the US living our best lives together and having fun.   Still haven't found Mable and her apple pie out there yet...

So, thank you my dear, and here's my little homage to her.
