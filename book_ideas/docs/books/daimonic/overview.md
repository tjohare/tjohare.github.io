# Overview

## StoryLine 1: "Daimonic"

!!! info " "
    _The word "Demon" which we commonly know today, is derived from "Daemon"._

    _Daemon is the Latin word for the Ancient Greek of `daimon` (δαίμων: "god", "godlike", "power", "fate"), which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit such as the daemons of ancient Greek religion and mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European *daimon "provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies), "* from the root da- "to divide". Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities, according to entry δαίμων at Liddell & Scott._

    _Additionally, For reference, BCE is short for Before Common Era. The Common Era begins with year 1 in the Gregorian calendar and is also known as the Western or Christian calendar._

### The First "Gods"

Generally the Oldest Deities are the Mesopotamian Gods.

The seven sages in Sumerian mythology sent to the earth by Anu (or Enki in some stories) at the beginning of time to give human beings the sacred 'me' (laws) of civilization. They were also known, by the Akkadians and Babylonians, as The Apkallu or the Apkallu Fish and are depicted with the body of a fish and the head of a man or with the torso of a fish and human arms, legs and head, sometimes with and sometimes without wings.  In the Babylonian tradition, the Apkallu also appear as Griffins or simply as humans with wings.

There are shrines to Enki dating back to the founding of the city of Eridu, considered by the Mesopotamians the first city established at the beginning of the world c. 5400 BCE.

_None of the old Gods actually were divine though..._
