# Hunting Season

_[Location: Mount Elbert, Colorado]_

Shortly after the 'incident', as it was being referred to in Grand Lake, the {{daimon.clan_name14}}s called for an emergency clan meet.  5 clans and their affiliate branches all showed up to the Mount Elbert clan hall.  

Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and often snow-capped even in the summer.   The Clan Meet Lodge that was established there is a testament to opulence and comfort, and in a location that is as rugged and ruthless as can be.  Its also completely hidden from human eyes.

Clan {{daimon.clan_name14}}, Clan {{daimon.clan_name15}}, Clan {{daimon.clan_name16}}, Clan {{daimon.clan_name17}}, and Clan {{daimon.clan_name18}}.  The 5 most powerful clans on the west coast of the United States were gathered with their leaders and officers.  A few suspected why they were called, but most were not expecting what would be asked of them.

Tensions were running high.  And as with any group of powerful people used to getting their way, they smiled, they nodded, and they barely held off killing each other.  Similar to Washington, DC politics.  With only slightly less backstabbing.

Joseph {{daimon.clan_name14}}, clan head and de facto Daimonic leader of North America's Western hemisphere, sat at a large round table, and brought the judge's gavel down on the wooden block before him.  The conversations around the room tapered off as Joseph politely waited, ready to lay out the reason for the meet.

"Elders, we have a problem that needs to be addressed," Joseph announced to the room.  "A week ago, several clan heirs were brutally attacked in our territory.  We need to formalize our response."

"I don't think so, Joseph.  If this is just about your son getting humiliated, then the problem you called us for, is not the problem.  The problem is that you think YOUR problem is OUR problem," replied Seraphina {{daimon.clan_name17}} smugly.

Joseph's head snapped to look at her and sneered, "Of course that would be **your** reply, lacking courage to face an adversary seems to be a {{daimon.clan_name17}} trait."  Clan members on both sides began to rise.

"Why don't you explain to us WHY this affects us, Joseph.  Looking at this from the outside, it appears to be an internal issue to just your people.  How does this affect the clans?" replied Dara {{daimon.clan_name18}}, gently laying a placating hand on Seraphina's shoulder, and to stop her from launching across the table at the {{daimon.clan_name14}} clan head.

"Though I would have thought this should be obvious to a real leader, there are several reasons for a unified response," replied Joseph, getting in a cheap shot.  "First, the designated clan heir was viciously attacked, unprovoked no less.  Unless you want your own heirs attacked unilaterally for some invisible perceived insult by any outside party, a response is required.  Secondly, by all accounts, this individual took out 3 future clan leaders with extensive combat experience very quickly, but didn't kill them.  This could be an agent for some other group or power trying to destabilize ours from within.   Or sow mistrust.  Or they could be a terrorist.  Either way, they need to be found and answer for their crimes.  A balancing response to their transgression."

"Extensive combat experience my ass," quietly muttered Seraphina.

"What did you have in mind," asked Dara looking around the room.

"I call for a Wild Hunt to be invoked."

Absolute silence engulfed the room.  The remaining clan leaders were stunned by the request.

"There hasn't been a Wild Hunt in hundreds of years.   It's usually invoked for murderers and betrayers!  Not someone who smacks around arrogant little bullies," shouted Seraphina, trying to stop the madness of the clan leader's request.  "Not to mention the cost involved!"

"I disagree Seraphina, this individual needs to learn their place in the order of things," replied Gabriel {{daimon.clan_name16}}.  "And this might be just the push some of our weaker members need to grow.  I agree with Clan {{daimon.clan_name14}}, and I second the call for the Wild Hunt."

"I call now for the vote to invoke the Wild Hunt.  I ask for a roll call to be recorded.  Clan {{daimon.clan_name14}} votes Aye."

"Clan {{daimon.clan_name16}} votes Aye."

"Clan {{daimon.clan_name17}} votes Nay."

"Clan {{daimon.clan_name18}} votes Nay."

"Clan {{daimon.clan_name15}} votes Aye."

Sighing, Dara adds reluctantly, "Do we even know where to find this individual?  Is he still in this area?" Everyone seems shocked at this turn of events.

"It does not matter," booms Joseph triumphantly.  "The Hunt has been called.  His fate is sealed."  

"If there is no further business for the clans to discuss, we are dismissed."
