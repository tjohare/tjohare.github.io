# Daimonic Affinity
What is Daimonic Affinity?  In it's most basic terms, it is the brand of power daimonic individuals wield.  All daimons have an affinity combination that is specific and unique to them.  

Altogether, the various daimonic clans and individuals rank others, and themselves, by what is known as 'The Affinity Breakdown.'  Affinity Breakdown is a combination of 3 different factors: Affinity Type, Purity, and Density.  

An individual's abilities and strength are determined by the combinations of these 3 factors.  As an example, the difference between a being able to deliver a hand-to-hand shocking touch versus a lightning bolt from 30 feet away.

Lastly, some individuals can perceive another's daimon's affinity breakdown as an Energy Field or Aura, represented as a colored corona that emanates from them.  This ability is extremely rare and prized within clans.

## Affinity Type  <!-- Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Nature, Ice, Lightning, Metal, Light, Dark, Life, Death, Blood, Mental, Spatial, Arcane, Void, Time -->
Affinity Type is the energy sphere or "school" that is associated to that individual and what they can wield, such as a primary element.  Traditionally, when tested, a single affinity type is dominant, and any others are listed as a secondary or subordinate type.   Having multiple affinity types available (ie. *{{daimon.psy_element_2}} and {{daimon.psy_element_5}}*) is not uncommon, but the likelihood of additionally affinity type decreases exponentially after the first.   Having all 8 affinity types is unprecedented.

The various affinity types are:

### {{daimon.psy_element_1}} <!-- wind -->

## Affinity Purity
Purity refers to the scope within that school.  Being able to do 1 or 2 things versus single, multiple, or area effects.  For gamers, think of purity as spell level.   If the purity is low, they can only do low level effects.  The higher the purity, the higher level effects that can be performed.  Additionally, purity levels can vary between affinity types.   It is not uncommon to have low affinity in one area and high in another.   It is very rare to have more than 1-2 types of affinity and is progressively rarer with additional affinities.

| Purity Level | Description        |
| :----------: | :----------------- |
| Low          | 1 function, maybe 2 at the most, simplistic.
| Medium       | 2-4 functions, static, immutable.
| High         | 5+ functions, indicative of noble bloodlines.
| Pristine     | 5+ functions, can combine with other affinities for <br> combination affects; no limit of what they can do.  <br> Legendary level, High Princes.

## Affinity Density
Density is the concentration amount of nanites in the blood.  Density is a crude benchmark for raw power.   An individual with a higher density can typically use an affinity, affecting more people over a larger area.   Hence, a density measure when daimonic children are entering adulthood to determine their place in society.

| Nanite PPM  | Description        |
| :---------: | :----------------- |
| 0           | Completely Human. No nanites present in the blood. <br> No Daimonic ancestry.
| 1-5         | Some Daimonic ancestry. Affinity inactive.
| 6-10        | Daimonic ancestry. Affinity may be activated <br> one-time during a severe crisis, like super strength <br> during a car wreak.
| 11-25       | Minor affinity power, very weak.
| 26-50       | Low affinity power.
| 51-75       | Average affinity power.
| 76-125      | Above Average affinity power, retainers and <br> special guards units are in this category.
| 126-500     | Noble houses and families.

## Breakdown and Rating
Breakdown and Ratings are displayed as "Affinity / Purity / Density."  They are primarily used to profile other daimonic entities.  To understand the breakdown, it would be presented as thus:

  * **Affinity Type**: First letter of the Type that is predominant (ie. A for Air, F for Fire).  Inidividuals with multiple types will display as a *(star) value.
  * **Affinity Purity**: First letter of the Type that is predominant (ie. L for Low, M for Medium)
  * **Affinity Density**: The numerical value of the amount of nanites

!!! success "AM85"
    This is an individual of the {{daimon.psy_element_1}} type, with 2-4 functions, and Above Average affinity power.  This is most likely a respected clan member or business leader.  Average and Respectable.

!!! warning "FH300"
    This is an individual of the {{daimon.psy_element_3}} type, 5+ functions, indicative of noble bloodlines, with considerable affinity density.  It is highly likely this is a high ranking member of a noble family.  Someone who can make your life extremely difficult.

---
## {{daimon.hero}}'s Breakdown and Rating
!!! danger "*P500+"
    This would flag multiple warning signs.  There is no singular dominant affinity type returned as {{daimon.hero_nickname}}'s affinities are in balance.  Additionally, {{daimon.hero_nickname}}'s is roughly about 1000 for baseline, and can vary that on the amount of power he channels to nanite replication.
