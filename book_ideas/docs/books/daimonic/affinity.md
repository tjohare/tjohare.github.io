# Daimonic Affinity
What is Daimonic Affinity?  In it's most basic terms, it is the brand of power Daimonic individuals wield.   

All daimons have an affinity that is specific and unique to them.  Additionally, all the various daimonic clans and individuals rank themselves by the affinity breakdown.  Affinity breakdown is a combination of 3 different factors: Affinity Type, Purity, and Density.  Abilities and Powers are also determined by the combinations of these 3 factors.  As an example, the difference between a hand-to-hand shock versus a lightning bolt.

Lastly, some individuals can perceive another's daimonic affinity as an Energy Field or Aura, as a colored emanation said to enclose a human, animal, or object.

## Affinity Type
Affinity Type is the energy sphere or "school" that is associated to that individual and what they can wield, such as a primary element.

## Affinity Purity
Purity refers to the scope within that school.  Being able to do 1 or 2 things versus single, multiple, or area effects.  For gamers, think of purity as spell level.   If the purity is low, they can only do low level effects.  The higher the purity, the higher level effects that can be performed.  Additionally, purity levels can vary between affinity types.   It is not uncommon to have low affinity in one area and high in another.   It is very rare to have more than 1-2 types of affinity and is progressively rarer with additional affinities.

| Purity Level | Description        |
| :----------: | :----------------- |
| Low          | 1 function, maybe 2 at the most, simplistic
| Medium       | 2-4 functions, static, immutable
| High         | 5+ functions, indicative of noble bloodlines
| Pristine     | 5+ functions, can combine with other affinities for <br> combination affects; no limit of what they can do.  <br> Legendary level, High Princes


## Affinity Density
Density is the concentration amount of nanites in the blood.  Density is a crude benchmark for raw power.   An individual with a higher density can typically use an affinity, affecting more people over a larger area.   Hence, a density measure when daimonic children are entering adulthood to determine their place in society.

| Nanite PPM  | Description        |
| :---------: | :----------------- |
| 0           | Completely Human. No nanites present in the blood. <br> No Daimonic ancestry
| 1-5         | Some Daimonic ancestry. Affinity inactive
| 6-10        | Daimonic ancestry. Affinity may be activated <br> one-time during a severe crisis, like super strength <br> during a car wreak.
| 11-25       | Minor affinity power, very weak
| 26-50       | Low affinity power
| 51-75       | Average affinity power
| 76-125      | Above Average affinity power, retainers and <br> special guards units are in this category
| 126-500     | Noble houses and families

## Breakdown and Rating
Breakdown and Ratings are displayed as "Affinity / Purity / Density."  They are primarily used to profile other daimonic entities.  To understand the breakdown, it would be presented as thus:
