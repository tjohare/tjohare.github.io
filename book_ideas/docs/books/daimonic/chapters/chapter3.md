# Chapter 3 - Pride and prejudice

_[Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}'s POV]_

{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}} {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}} was sweeping the general store.  She was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11" and classically pretty.  Dirty blond hair and blue eyes.  She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew, but she was very fit though, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic'.  Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart.   

Which contributed to her constant anger and soul-crushing sadness.

"{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}!  I need you to get my laundry done.   I'm running out of gym shirts to wear," whined {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, her younger brother, town bully, and general bane of her existence.  

Although {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} was her younger brother, he inherited a great deal more daimonic power than {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}.  More so than most others in their clan.  As such, he was the favored son, the golden boy.  

And he lorded it over everyone.

"This is such bullshit," she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away.  "He's a bully and he's lazy.  He's going to get us into trouble some day.  I guarantee it."

The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}}.  {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}} groaned.   "Great.  The evil minion twins too."  She couldn't contain the sarcasm in her voice.

Turning to {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}}, "Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to you," announced Sachi.  

"We were asked to bring you by real quick," replied Asher.  

Asher and Sachi {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}} were fraternal brother-and-sister twins who did everything together and routinely finished each other sentences.  And they were also known to share a malicious streak a mile wide.  They fawned all over {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}}, and often helped him pick on others around the area.

"Thanks, you two."  {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} turned to {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}, "I need you to get that laundry done, sis.  Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again.  I'd hate for you to be whipped.," he sneered to his sister.  

She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on.  The anger and sadness within her grew.  As he walked off, she looked up, tears pooling in her eyes, and whispered, "Someday.  Someday I'll show them."

{{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} put the truck in park, turned the key off, and stepped out of the vehicle.  He realized that, in addition to the possible band-aids, he needed a few things and toiletries. The general store, while small, should have everything he needed.  

Opening the front door, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} heard the bell chime.  Sitting at the check-out counter reading a hard cover novel was one of the prettiest girls, in {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}'s opinion, had ever seen.  She was tall and lean, and intelligent looking.  The word that came to mind was 'fierce' when he was looking at her.  Before his thoughts could continue though, he received a curious warning from {{extra.daimon.ai_name}}.

!!! info "Be warned {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  She's a Daimon like you, but if I reading her energy correctly, she's very, very  underpowered.  She's possibly the clan's Omega.  She'd be a good opponent to work on."

`Wait... what do you mean "Clan's Omega?" I don't get that...`

!!! info "There's a lot of culture and backstory you're missing because you didn't grow up in this environment.  First, Daimonic society is based on strength and power. The strong rule.  In many ways, Daimons are a lot like wolves.  They are predators.  The weakest member of the clan is the omega.  These members are routinely bullied or rejected, forced out of the clan.  It reinforces the ideal of grow, or die."

`Are you freakin' serious?!?  So it doesn't matter what she looks like, how smart she could be, or what her personality is, or... most  importantly here, if she's a really good person or not.  If she's got no power, she gets crapped on?  By everyone?  Am I understanding what Omega means now?`

!!! info "Correct."

`That's some Bull. Shit.  And not just shortened to BS, that gets the whole damn word.`

{{extra.daimon.hero}} quietly browsed through the aisles, mulling over what he had just learned from {{extra.daimon.ai_nickname}}.
The front door bell chimed once more and {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} looked up from his perusing.  

In walked 3 young adults, heading straight for blond-haired clerk he passed earlier.  They couldn't see him so he quietly watched what was going on.

"Hey {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}, I just heard you didn't finish cleaning up the ranch houses yesterday, like father asked you to.  You remember, the rental units that give the clan financial stability.  He's none to happy at the moment.  I told him I'd make sure you got it done immediately."  The young bully jeered at the blond clerk.  The other two young adults next to him, sniggered, and appeared to be related, possibly twins, and were now laughing along with the young bully.

"{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}}, I wasn't told about them until the end of the day.  There was no way I could finish cleaning them.  I was goi-"

Before she could finish her sentence though, the bully backhanded her across the face.  Hard.  Calculating his reaction, {{extra.daimon.ai_nickname}} interjected.

!!! info "{{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}, they are all Daimons.  All from the same clan according to their DNA.  Hmm, the alpha is considerably more powerful than the girl.  He's about your strength currently but his power well is significantly smaller than ours.  Much, Much smaller.  You could probably take all of them if you utilize your healing, along with physical and psychic enhancements.  But speed would be key here."
