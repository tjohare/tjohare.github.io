# Chapter 3 - Pride and prejudice

_[Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}'s POV]_

{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}} {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}} was sweeping the general store.  She was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11" and classically pretty.  Dirty blond hair and blue eyes.  She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew, but she was very fit though, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic'.  Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart.   

Which contributed to her constant anger and soul-crushing sadness.

"{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}!  I need you to get my laundry done.   I'm running out of gym shirts to wear," whined {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, her younger brother, town bully, and general bane of her existence.  

Although {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} was her younger brother, he inherited a great deal more daimonic power than {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}.  More so than most others in their clan.  As such, he was the favored son, the golden boy.  

And he lorded it over everyone.

"This is such bullshit," she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away.  "He's a bully and he's lazy.  He's going to get us into trouble some day.  I guarantee it."

The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}}.  {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}} groaned.   "Great.  The evil minion twins too."  She couldn't contain the sarcasm in her voice.

Turning to {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}}, "Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to you," announced Sachi.  

"We were asked to bring you by real quick," replied Asher.  

Asher and Sachi {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}} were fraternal brother-and-sister twins who routinely finished each other sentences, but were known to share a malicious streak a mile wide.  They also fawned all over {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}}, and often helped him pick on others around the area.

"Thanks, you two."  {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} turned to {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}, "I need that laundry done, sis.  Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again," as he sneered to his sister.  

She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on.  The anger and sadness within her grew.  She looked up, closed her eyes, and whispered, "Someday.  Someday I'll show them my worth."

{{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} put the truck in park, turned the key off, and stepped out of the vehicle.  He realized that, in addition to the possible band-aids, he needed a few things and toiletries. The general store, while small, should have everything.  

Opening the front door, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} heard the bell chime.  Sitting at the check-out counter reading a hard cover novel was one of the prettiest girls, in {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}'s opinion, had ever seen.  She was tall and lean, and intelligent looking.  The word that came to mind was 'fierce' when he was looking at her.  Before his thoughts could continue though, he received a curious warning from {{extra.daimon.ai_name}}.

!!! info "Be warned {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  She's a Daimon like you, but if I reading her energy correctly, she's very underpowered.  She's possibly the clan's Omega.  She'd be a good opponent to work on."

`Wait... what do you mean "Clan's Omega?" I don't get that...`

!!! info "There's a lot of culture and backstory you're missing because you didn't grow up in this environment.  First, Daimonic society is based on strength and power. In many ways, they are predators.  A lot like wolves.  The weakest member of the pack, or clan, is the omega.  These members are routinely bullied or rejected.  Grow, or die."

`Are you freakin' serious?!?  So it doesn't matter what she looks like or her personality is, or if she's a good person or not.  If she's got no power, she gets crapped on by everyone? Am I understanding it now?`

!!! info "Correct."

`That's bullshit.  Not just BS, it gets the whole damn word.`
