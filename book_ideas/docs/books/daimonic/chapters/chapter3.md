# Chapter 3 - Pride

_[Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}'s POV]_

{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}} {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}} was sweeping the general store.  She was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11" and classically pretty.  She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew, but she was very fit though, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic'.  Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart.   

Which contributed to her constant anger and soul-crushing sadness.

"{{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}!  I need you to get my laundry done.   I'm running out of gym shirts to wear," whined {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, her younger brother, town bully, and general bane of her existence.  

Although {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} was her younger brother, he inherited a great deal more daimonic power than {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}.  More so than most others in their clan.  As such, he was the favored son, the golden boy.  

And he lorded it over everyone.

"This is such bullshit," she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away.  "He's a bully and he's lazy.  He's going to get us into trouble some day.  I guarantee it."

The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}}.  {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}} groaned.   "Great.  The evil minion twins too."

"Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}}," announced Sachi.  

"We were asked to bring him by real quick," replied Asher.  

Asher and Sachi {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}} were fraternal brother-and-sister twins who routinely finished each other sentences, but shared a malicious streak a mile wide.

"Thanks, you two."  {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_brother}} turned to {{extra.daimon.hero_bestfriend_angel_fn}}, "I need that laundry done, sis.  Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again," as he sneered to his sister.  

She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on.  The anger and sadness within her grew.  She looked up, closed her eyes, and whispered, "Someday.  Someday I'll show them my worth."
