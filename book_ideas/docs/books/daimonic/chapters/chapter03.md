# Pride & Prejudice

_[Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}'s POV]_

{{daimon.hero_friend_angel}} {{daimon.clan_name14}} was sweeping the general store.  Just as she did every day for the last four years, since her sixteenth birthday.  With shoulder length dirty blond hair and blue eyes, she was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11" and had a classically pretty face.  She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew.  She was however, very fit, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic' if anything.  Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart.   

Which contributed to her almost constant anger and soul-crushing sadness.

"{{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}!  I need you to get my laundry done.   I'm running out of gym shirts and clothes to wear," coming out from the back room whined {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} {{daimon.clan_name14}}; who was the town bully, and general bane of her existence.  

Although {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} was also, her younger brother, and he inherited a great deal more power than {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}.  Even more so than most others in their clan.  As such, he was his father's favored son, the golden boy.  The next clan heir, just like their father.

And he lorded it over everyone.  Especially {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}.

"This is such bullshit," she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away.  "He's a bully and he's lazy.  He's going to get us and the clan into serious trouble some day.  I guarantee it."

The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi {{daimon.clan_name15}}.  {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}} groaned.   "Great.  The evil minion twins too," she whispered.  She couldn't contain the sarcasm in her voice.

Turning to {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}, "Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to you," announced Sachi.  

"We were asked to bring you by real quick," replied Asher.  

Asher and Sachi {{daimon.clan_name15}} were {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}'s cousins as well as fraternal brother-and-sister twins who did everything together, routinely finishing each other sentences.  And they were also known to share a malicious streak a mile wide.  They fawned over {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}, sucked up to him, and often helped him pick on others around the area.  

"Thanks, you two."  {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} turned to {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}, "I need you to get that laundry done, sis.  Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again.  I'd hate for you to be punished over something so trivial," he sneered to his sister.  

Frustrated, she just sighed.  She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on.  The anger and sadness within her grew.  As he walked off, she looked up, tears pooling in her eyes, and whispered, "Someday.  Someday I'll show them."

{{daimon.hero_nickname}} put the truck in park, turned the key off, and stepped out of the vehicle.  He realized that, in addition to the possible band-aids, he needed a few things and toiletries. The general store, while small, should have everything he needed.  

Opening the front door, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} heard the bell chime.  Sitting at the check-out counter reading a hard cover novel was one of the prettiest girls, in {{daimon.hero_nickname}}'s opinion, he'd seen.  She was tall and lean, and intelligent looking as she focused on reading her novel.  The word that came to mind was 'fierce' after a while, when he was still looking at her.  Before his thoughts could continue though, he received a curious warning from {{daimon.ai_name}}.

!!! info "Be warned {{daimon.hero_nickname}}.  She's a Daimon like you, but if I reading her energy correctly, she's very, very  underpowered.  She's possibly the clan's Omega.  She'd be a good opponent to work on."

`OH Cool!  Maybe I could talk to her, and... wait... what do you mean "Clan's Omega?" I don't get that...`

!!! info "There's a lot of culture and backstory you're missing because you didn't grow up in this environment.  First, Daimonic society is based on strength and power.  The strong rule.  In many ways, Daimons are a lot like wolves.  They are predators.  The weakest member of the clan is the omega.  These members are routinely bullied or rejected, until they are forced out of the clan.  It reinforces the ideal of grow, or die."

`Are you freakin' serious?!?  So it doesn't matter what she looks like, how smart she could be, or what her personality is, or... most importantly here, if she's a really good person or not.  If she's got no power, she gets crapped on?  By everyone?  Am I understanding what Omega means now?`

!!! info "Correct."

`That's some Bull. Shit.  And not just shortened to BS, that gets the whole damn word.`

{{daimon.hero}} quietly browsed through the aisles, mulling over what he had just learned from {{daimon.ai_nickname}}.
The front door bell chimed once more and {{daimon.hero_nickname}} looked up from his perusing.  

In walked 3 young adults, heading straight for blond-haired clerk he passed earlier.  They couldn't see him so he quietly watched what was going on.

"Hey {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}, I just heard you didn't finish cleaning up the ranch houses yesterday, like father asked you to.  You remember, the rental units that give the clan financial stability.  He's none to happy at the moment.  I told him I'd make sure you got it done immediately."  The young bully jeered at the blond clerk.  The other two young adults next to him, initially sniggered, but were now openly laughing along with the young bully.

"{{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}, I wasn't told about them until the end of the day.  There was no way I could finish cleaning them.  I was goi-"

Before she could finish her sentence though, the bully backhanded her across the face.  Hard.  Calculating his reaction, {{daimon.ai_nickname}} interjected.

!!! info "Hold on {{daimon.hero_nickname}}, be aware, they are all Daimons.  All from the same clan according to their DNA scans.  Hmm, the alpha is considerably more powerful than the girl.  He's about your strength currently but his available power level is significantly less than ours.  Much, Much smaller.  In fact, you could probably take all of them if you activate your abilities together.  But speed would be key here.  And it wouldn't last very long."

`OK, lets prep Strength, Speed, Perception, and Skin hardening nanite subroutines.  Overlay some metal knuckle formations on the elemental enhancement side.  On my command. `

!!! info "Nanites prepped and ready.   Enhancement programs standing by to activate."

Taking a deep breath, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} stepped out, and walked toward the counter.  "Hey asshole, you like hitting girls.  Maybe I should give you a lesson in manners," {{daimon.hero_nickname}} exclaimed as he stalked down the aisle towards the group, eyes focused on the one the clerk named {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}.

"Do you have any idea of who I am?  This is my store, get the hell out of here, Loser,"  {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} replied laughing, dismissing {{daimon.hero_nickname}} as he approached.

"Asher, get rid him," {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} turned to face back to {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}, waving his hand to brush off the whole situation.

Asher grabbed {{daimon.hero}} by the arm, and motioned to steer him to the door.

`{{daimon.ai_nickname}}?  Activate.`

Power flooded {{daimon.hero_nickname}}'s body.  It felt like an electric current going through his body, as his muscles grew more dense and powerful.  Time appeared to slow down a little bit as his speed and perception increased dramatically.  His skin thickened and became more dense, like leather.  He could see {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}'s eyes start to widen in his time-accelerated state, recognition settling in for her.  

Breaking his grip, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} planted a palm strike to the center of Asher's chest and watched him fly back into the wall.  Sachi, wide eyed and jaw hanging open, just stared at him, then at her brother in shock.  Until Asher groaned from the floor, not getting up right away.  She looked back at {{daimon.hero_nickname}} and took a swing.  

Blocking her strike and grabbing her wrist, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} used her momentum, and turned her into a full hip throw, tossing Sachi right back at her brother.  The twins crashed together in a heap just as Asher tried to get up, and now both twins were back on the floor, swaying and trying to clear their heads.  Both now out of the action.

{{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} was utterly frozen, unmoving with the biggest eyes {{daimon.hero}} had ever seen.  He watched unbelieving, as the event played out in front of him.  Both of his cousins were taken out by an outsider.  {{daimon.hero_nickname}} turned to {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} and said, "You ARE... going to be... my little bitch."

As if breaking the spell over him, rage came over on {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}'s face, and he took a wild haymaker swing at {{daimon.hero_nickname}}.  {{daimon.hero_nickname}} blocked and, while {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}'s arm was hyper extended, he snapped the elbow easily.  {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} screamed in pain, and tried to take another swing with the other arm.   Again, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} blocked with the other arm and then snapped that elbow too.  Fear and Pain overwhelmed him, and as {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}'s screams rose in both octave and volume, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} finally gut punched him, then kneed him to the face to silence him.

{{daimon.hero_nickname}} looked down on his fallen foe.  {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} wasn't moving.

{{daimon.hero_nickname}} finally turned to {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}} and softly asked, "You ok?"

Staring at {{daimon.hero_nickname}} wide eyed, she finally shrieked, "YOU ATTACKED MY BROTHER!!"  {{daimon.hero_nickname}} snorted.

"If that's your family, your family sucks."

That statement seemed to deflate her, and she sank down in her chair.  A sense of finality and despair seemed to engulf her.  After a few seconds, she whispered, "They are going to take it out on me when you leave."  

{{daimon.hero_nickname}} studied her, finally reaching out and touched her where {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}} had back handed her.   Pushing healing energy into her face, {{daimon.hero_nickname}} replied, "You are not alone.  If you need friend, I'm staying at the old 'Higant' house on the lake."  Then softly added, "And I don't have any friends, not like us."

{{daimon.hero_nickname}} smiled sadly, turned, and walked out the store's front door.  

Awe and wonder dominated {{daimon.hero_friend_angel}}'s face.  She couldn't believe what just happened.  Someone had stood up to her brother.  Stood up for her.  Even more shocking, he was a healer.  There hadn't been a healer since she could remember.  It had to have been generations since the last healer.   

She didn't know what her clan would do.   Would they seek revenge for {{daimon.hero_friend_angel_brother}}'s beat down and humiliation?  Or would they seek to tie him to the clan in some way as a healer?  She had no clue.  Should she even tell them he was a healer.

Hell, thinking back to his offer, she didn't know what she wanted either.

But Maybe.  Hopefully.  She had at least started to make a friend.  She wasn't sure though.

She didn't have any friends either.

!!! info "Foolish.  You let her know where we are staying.  If she betrays us to her clan, they will come down on us in force.  You do not have the power, nor the experience to survive an encounter like that.  You've put yourself in danger unnecessarily."

`I thought of that.   But... It WAS necessary.  It was necessary for me, for my soul, for my mental well being.  I needed to make sure I'm still going to do the right thing when everything else goes to crap.  And you're forgetting something very important.  You said we'll eventually be found.  If she doesn't tell anyone where we are, we'll know without a doubt she can be trusted.  And that made it worth it.`

!!! info "Not completely worth it.  We still didn't pick up the supplies and toiletries we initially went there for."

`Damnit!!`
