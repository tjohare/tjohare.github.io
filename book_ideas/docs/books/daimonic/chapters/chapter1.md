# Chapter 1

{{extra.daimon.hero}} watched the testing framework run.   The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically.  A lot was riding on this test run.   His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent.  They were a small, young team and every win counted.  After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report.   15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl.  You could have heard a pin drop.

!!! Success "Application performing as expected for all tests.  No errors found."

Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around.  The collective sigh of relief was palpable.  Mary Addison, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry.   

"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer.  First round is on me."  {{extra.daimon.hero}} said with a smile to the team.  

The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world.   Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm.  However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them.   "No pressure then" was a re-occurring office catch phrase.

About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent.  Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected.   The security application that {{extra.daimon.hero}}'s team came up with, was ground breaking.   An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering.   A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around.  Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out.   Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs.   "{{extra.daimon.hero_fullname}}" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up.  

Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order.   _`Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though.  Meh, I've got time`_, he thought.  

Hell, what was the worst that could happen?

Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for {{extra.daimon.hero}}, the comfort of driving a luxury "tank" always relaxed him.  He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work.  A little "pat on the back" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the "hoity-toity" of society.   One thing was abundantly clear, {{extra.daimon.hero}} did not fit in with "it" crowd.  Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit.

"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,"  said a smug-sounding security guard as {{extra.daimon.hero}} approached the front entrance.  

"Funny.  You can check for my name on the list though.  '{{extra.daimon.hero_fullname}}'.  You DO... know how to read, yes?"  {{extra.daimon.hero}} said with a false smile and laughing eyes.  

"Huh, it's on the list.  Congrats on being more than a '+1'.  Have a good night, sir," the guard smugly replied.

_`Wow, What a douche canoe,`_ I thought to myself.  I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements. Random Obscure Fact, Chaste tree berry was also known as "Monk's pepper" and was used to dampen libido[^1] in the Middle Ages.   Don't ask me why I know that or even remember it, I just do.

I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named "_{{extra.daimon.bus_app_name}}_", or ASHLE for short.  The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls.  The people there was standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed.  Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing.  It was more social than educational with this crowd.
