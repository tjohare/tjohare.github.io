# Chapter 1 - The Awakening

_[Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL]_

{{extra.daimon.hero}} watched the testing framework run.   The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically.  A lot was riding on this test run.   His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent.  They were a small, young team and every win counted.  After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report.   15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl.  You could have heard a pin drop.

!!! Success "Application performing as expected for all tests.  No errors found."

Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around.  The collective sigh of relief was palpable.  Mary Addison, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry.   

"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer.  First round is on me."  {{extra.daimon.hero}} said with a smile to the team.  

The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world.   Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm.  However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them.   "No pressure then" was a re-occurring office catch phrase.

About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent.  Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected.   The security application that {{extra.daimon.hero}}'s team came up with, was ground breaking.   An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering.   A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around.  Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out.   Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs.   "{{extra.daimon.hero_fullname}}" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up.  

Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order.   

`Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though.  Meh, I've got time.`  

`Hell, what's the worst that could happen?`

Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for {{extra.daimon.hero}}, the comfort of driving a luxury "tank" always relaxed him.  He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work.  A little "pat on the back" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the "hoity-toity" of society.   One thing was abundantly clear, {{extra.daimon.hero}} did not fit in with "it" crowd.  Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit.

"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,"  said a smug-sounding security guard as {{extra.daimon.hero}} approached the front entrance.  

"Funny.  You can check for my name on the list though.  '{{extra.daimon.hero_fullname}}'.  You DO... know how to read, yes?"  {{extra.daimon.hero}} said with a false smile and laughing eyes.  

"Huh, it's on the list.  Congrats on being more than a '+1'.  Have a good night, sir," the guard smugly replied.

`Wow, What a douche canoe.`

{{extra.daimon.hero}} chuckled as he thought to myself, he thought,

`I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements to suppress his libido.`

I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the "{{extra.daimon.bus_app_name}}", or ASHLE for short.  The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls.  The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed.  Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing.  It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, {{extra.daimon.hero}} spotted his target.

"Good evening, Mr. {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}.  How are you tonight?" asked {{extra.daimon.hero}}.

"Ah, Good evening to you, {{extra.daimon.hero}}.  We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight.  Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?"  he coolly asked.   He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it.

"Actually, we finished tonight.  All tests passing, and all requirements met.  Ahead of schedule too, I might add," replied {{extra.daimon.hero}}.  The soft smile continued.  "I wanted to bring you the good news in person.  All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate."

"Outstanding news, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  This does call for a toast."  A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}'s face.  No man should be that pretty.  The one time {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} stopped by his firm's office, he noticed that everyone, LITERALLY everyone, in that office was gorgeous.  Like it was some sort of unspoken corporate requirement for them to be good looking as well as intelligent.  

`Quite frankly, that was disheartening.`

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} continues speaking, "There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related.  I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward.  And Rich."

My first thought is, "It's not about the money."  But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, "When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money."  

`Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like?`

"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}.  I'm going to meet up with the rest of my coworkers to try to salvage the rest of my ni-"

An quick series of loud and bright explosions ripples out from the main entrance.  There's not that much the way in damage, but the flash of temporary blindness and sharp ringing in our ears is a testament that something has gone catastrophically bad.

"GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR DIE!" is heard loud and clear, repeated over and over to various huddled groups.  This is quickly followed by the sounds of automatic gunfire.  

{{extra.daimon.hero}} remained strangely calm throughout all this, and was quickly and smoothly getting down on the floor, as the robbery crew asked.  But that's not what caught {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}'s eye and held his attention.  As {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} turned to face them, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} swore he saw a silver-bluish aura surround {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}'s form.  

Rage and Anger flashed in his eyes and a primal scream tore out of his throat.   {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} charged his attackers, and they turned and fired upon him.   It must have been the shock and confusion of the moment, because it appeared that none of the bullets fired seemed to hit {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} before he was upon them.

And then it got ugly. I did't want to stare, but I just couldn't look away.  {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} was breaking arms, and crushing faces.  One of the rifleman literally had an indentation in his skull from a punch.   I didn't know whether to cheer or throw up it was so vicious.

And just when I thought it couldn't get more surreal, two other individuals slowly stalked into the room and it was like a bad horror movie come to life.

One looked something like an armored version of Michael Myers, with his porcelain mask actually in a sneer and a blood-encrusted hand axe.   The other was a god-damned werewolf, so lifelike I thought it had to be some sort of theme-park animatronic.   But it was far too real and graceful for that.   I don't think my psyche accepted what I was seeing.  I'll never forget the first thought to run through my head on seeing them walk into the room.

`This is ridiculous.  I'm never going to a museum again.`

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} looked at the newcomers with wild eyes and a pronouced sense of bloodlust, breathing heavier and heavier each passing second; and then he just charged them.   The werewolf moved to intercept him and the Mike Myers character skirted around the side, appearing to flank him.  2 versus 1 is not good odds any day of the week, in any situation.  Add to that, that one of the robbers was wielding an axe and the one individual we had on our side seemed to be out of his mind with rage, things looked rather grim.  It was time to look for an exit strategy.  

Or as I've been routinely texted, from my development staff for staying late in the office, "GTFO {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}".

Thankfully, {{extra.daimon.hero}} was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'.  

The entire situation, however was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though.  {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} and the Werewolf were locked together hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor.  Violently and explosively crashing into them.

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} was holding his own though, {{extra.daimon.hero}} would give him that.  The werewolf's ax-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} used the werewolf as a shield, the couple of times he moved in.  As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike.  It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point.

With all of the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons realized they were being ignored, and started to get up and make a run for the exits.  Some of were uninjured, some were in shock, and others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury.  It was pure pandemonium.  And still, {{extra.daimon.hero}} watched these combatants fling each other around and try to kill each other.   Something kept him locked in place though, he wasn't afraid per se but he was looking at the fight in a more analytical view, more studious, almost.... judgmental.

Just then, they crashed into a huge stone relief of one of the winged 'Annunaki', which was one of the ancient Mesopotamian gods.  Stone chunks were flung around the room, and priceless artifacts instantly became dust and debris.  A haze of dust and smoke was starting to fill the room, and {{extra.daimon.hero}} heard a light chime, like some metal or crystal near the floor coming his way.  Catching his eye as it slid toward him, was a large sapphire gem of the deepest royal blue he'd ever seen.

Another crash resounded around the room, more violent than the last, and {{extra.daimon.hero}} knew he needed to move now.   As he moved to get up and turned for the side emergency fire exit, he reached out and grabbed the gem.  A mild electric shock traveled up his arm and stopped his movements.   But that wasn't what had him locked in place and blinking furiously.   He was clearly hearing words that he should NOT be hearing.

`What.  The Hell.  Is going on?`

Another roar echoed from the combatants, and this time, without looking back, {{extra.daimon.hero}} moved and continued his escape out the museum.  Presumptively, he thought,

`Thank God I drive a tank.`

The scene outside the museum was what you'd expect it to be.  One expensive localized disaster.  In some ways, it resembled someone kicking over an ant hill.   Well-dressed patrons, donors, museum staff, and clueless bystanders, all running and hustling in multiple directions at once.   The sound of police sirens and fire engines could now be heard off in the background but steadily gaining strength and closing the distance.   {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} pulled out his keys, turned the car alarm off, and jumped in his truck.  The adrenaline from the escape was now starting to come down and exhaustion was creeping in.   Turning the truck on, and running his hands through his hair, he started to prioritize.

`OK, Get home, Food and Hot shower, before I start to really freak out.`

{{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} pulled onto the main street and sped away from the downtown scene as fast as he could.  He didn't care about speeding or getting a ticket.   It appeared that all the attention was focused behind him, with every emergency service vehicle moving in that direction.  

He turned onto Interstate I-95, and started driving northbound, driving virtually on auto-pilot to get home as fast as possible.  After a while, numb, and unaware of how much time had passed, he finally walked in the door of his home, and the events of that evening started to replay in his mind.   Grabbing some Nature Valley and pemmican bars he kept for hiking out of the pantry, he tore into them, sat down and thought on all that had happened tonight.   

`This is crazy.  Who were those guys?  What did they want?  And... hey, wait a minute, what the hell happened to that gem I grabbed?`

!!! warning "Daimonic AI bonding complete.  DNA restructuring and gene therapy commencing now..."

Pain wracked through his entire body.  Everything felt as if it was on fire.  His stomach violently twisted and he felt as if he was going to retch, throwing up his stomach contents.   But a smooth deep voice dominated this mind.

!!! info "Hello {{extra.daimon.hero}}.  I hope you prove worthy..."


`What ...`

And {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} slipped into oblivion.
