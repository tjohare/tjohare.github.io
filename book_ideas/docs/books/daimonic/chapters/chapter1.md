# Chapter 1

{{extra.daimon.hero}} watched the testing framework run.   The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically.  A lot was riding on this test run.   His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent.  They were a small, young team and every win counted.  After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report.   15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl.  You could have heard a pin drop.

!!! Success "Application performing as expected for all tests.  No errors found."

Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around.  The collective sigh of relief was palpable.  Mary Addison, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry.   

"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer.  First round is on me."  {{extra.daimon.hero}} said with a smile to the team.  

The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world.   Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm.  However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them.   "No pressure then" was a re-occurring office catch phrase.

About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent.  Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected.   The security application that {{extra.daimon.hero}}'s team came up with, was ground breaking.   An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering.   A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around.  Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out.   Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs.   "{{extra.daimon.hero_fullname}}" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up.  

Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order.   

_`Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though.  Meh, I've got time`_, he thought.  

_`Hell, what's the worst that could happen?`_

Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for {{extra.daimon.hero}}, the comfort of driving a luxury "tank" always relaxed him.  He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work.  A little "pat on the back" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the "hoity-toity" of society.   One thing was abundantly clear, {{extra.daimon.hero}} did not fit in with "it" crowd.  Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit.

"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,"  said a smug-sounding security guard as {{extra.daimon.hero}} approached the front entrance.  

"Funny.  You can check for my name on the list though.  '{{extra.daimon.hero_fullname}}'.  You DO... know how to read, yes?"  {{extra.daimon.hero}} said with a false smile and laughing eyes.  

"Huh, it's on the list.  Congrats on being more than a '+1'.  Have a good night, sir," the guard smugly replied.

_`Wow, What a douche canoe.`_

I chuckled as I thought to myself.  I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements. Random Obscure Fact, Chaste tree berry was also known as "Monk's pepper" and was used to dampen libido in the Middle Ages.   Don't ask me why I know that or even remember it, I just do.

I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the "_{{extra.daimon.bus_app_name}}_", or ASHLE for short.  The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls.  The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed.  Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing.  It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, {{extra.daimon.hero}} spotted his target.

"Good evening, Mr. {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}.  How are you tonight?" asked {{extra.daimon.hero}}.

"Ah, Good evening to you, {{extra.daimon.hero}}.  We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight.  Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?"  he coolly asked.   He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it.

"Actually, we finished tonight.  All tests passing, and all requirements met.  Ahead of schedule too, I might add," replied {{extra.daimon.hero}}.  The soft smile continued.  "I wanted to bring you the good news in person.  All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate."

"Outstanding news, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  This _**does**_ call for a toast."  A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}'s face.  No man should be that pretty.  Quite frankly, it's disheartening.  "There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related.  I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward."

My first thought is, "It's not about the money."  But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, "When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money."  

`Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like?`

"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}.  I'm going to meet up with the rest of my coworkers to try to salvage the rest of my ni-"

An quick series of loud and bright explosions ripples out from the main entrance.  There's not that much the way in damage, but the flash of temporary blindness and sharp ringing in our ears is a testament that something has gone catastrophically bad.

"GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR DIE!" is heard loud and clear, repeated over and over to various huddled groups.  This is quickly followed by the sounds of automatic gunfire.  

{{extra.daimon.hero}} remained strangely calm throughout all this, and was quickly and smoothly getting down on the floor, as the robbery crew asked.  But that's not what caught {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}'s eye and held his attention.  As {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} turned to face them, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} swore he saw a silver-bluish aura surround {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}}'s form.  

Rage and Anger flashed in his eyes and a primal scream tore out of his throat.   {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} charged his attackers, and they turned and fired upon him.   It must have been the shock and confusion of the moment, because it appeared that none of the bullets fired seemed to hit {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} before he was upon them.

And then it got ugly. I did't want to stare, but I just couldn't look away.  {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} was breaking arms, and crushing faces.  One of the rifleman literally had an indentation in his skull from a punch.   I didn't know whether to cheer or throw up it was so vicious.

And just when I thought it couldn't get more surreal, two other individuals slowly stalked into the room and it was like a bad horror movie come to life.

One looked something like an armored version of Michael Myers, with his porcelain mask actually in a sneer and a blood-encrusted hand axe.   The other was a god-damned werewolf, so lifelike I thought it had to be some sort of theme-park animatronic.   But it was far too real and graceful for that.   I don't think my psyche accepted what I was seeing.  I'll never forget the first thought to run through my head on seeing them walk into the room.

`This is ridiculous.  I'm never going to a museum again.`

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} looked at the newcomers with wild eyes and a pronouced sense of bloodlust, breathing heavier and heavier each passing second; and then he just charged them.   The werewolf moved to intercept him and the Mike Myers character skirted around the side, appearing to flank him.  2 versus 1 is not good odds any day of the week, in any situation.  Add to that, that one of the robbers was wielding an axe and the one individual we had on our side seemed to be out of his mind with rage, things looked rather grim.  It was time to look for an exit strategy.  

Or as I've been routinely texted, from my development staff for staying late in the office, "GTFO {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}".
