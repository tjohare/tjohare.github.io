# Chapter 4 - Hunting Season

_[Location: Mount Elbert, Colorado]_

Shortly after the 'incident', as it was being referred to in Grand Lake, the {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}s called for an emergency clan meet.  The 5 largest clans and their affiliate branches all showed up to the Mount Elbert clan hall.  

Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}}, Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name16}}, Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name17}}, and Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name18}}.  The most powerful clans on the west coast of the United States.

And as with any group of powerful people, they smiled, they nodded, and they barely held off killing each other.  Eventually, they decided to just ignore each other.

Joseph {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, clan head and de facto Daimonic leader of North America, sat at a large round table, and brought the judge's gavel down on the wooden block before him.  The conversations tapered off as Joseph politely waited, ready to lay out the problem for them to address.

"Elders, we have a problem that needs to be addressed," Joseph announced to the room.

"I don't think so.  If this is about your son getting humiliated, then the problem you called us for, is not the problem.  The problem is that you think YOUR problem is OUR problem," replied Seraphina {{extra.daimon.clan_name17}} smugly.

Joseph's head snapped to look at her and sneered, "Of course that would be **your** reply, lacking courage to face an adversary seems to be a {{extra.daimon.clan_name17}} trait."

"Why don't you explain to us WHY this affects us, Joseph.  Looking at this from the outside, it appears to just be an internal issue to your people." replied Dara {{extra.daimon.clan_name18}}, gently laying a placating hand on Seraphina's shoulder to stop her from launching across the table at the {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}} clan head.

"Though this should be obvious to a real leader, there are several reasons for a unified response.  First, the designated clan heir was viciously attacked, unprovoked no less.  Unless you want your own heirs attacked unilaterally for some invisible perceived insult, a response is required.  Secondly, by all accounts, this individual took out 3 future clan leaders with extensive combat experience very quickly, but didn't kill them.  This could be an agent for some other group or power trying to destabilize ours.   Or sow mistrust.  Or they could be a terrorist.  They need to be found and answer for their crimes. Therefore, I call for a Wild Hunt to be invoked against this individual."

The remaining clan leaders were stunned by the request.

"There hasn't been a Wild Hunt in hundreds of years.   It's usually invoked for murderers and betrayers!  Not someone who smacks around arrogant little bullies," shouted Seraphina, trying to stop the madness of the clan leader's request.

"I disagree Seraphina, this individual needs to learn their place in the order of things," blurts Gabriel {{extra.daimon.clan_name16}}.  "And this might be just the push some of our weaker members need to grow.  I agree with Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, and I too call for the Wild Hunt."

"Do we even know where to find this individual?  Is he still in this area?", adds Dara reluctantly, seemingly shocked at this turn of events.

"It does not matter," booms Joseph triumphantly.  "The Hunt has been called.  His fate is sealed."  

"If there is no further business for the clans to discuss, we are dismissed."
