# Chapter 2

Thankfully, {{extra.daimon.hero}} was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'.  

The entire situation however, was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though.  {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} and the Werewolf were locked together hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor.  Violently and explosively crashing into them.

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} was holding his own though, {{extra.daimon.hero}} would give him that.  The werewolf's ax-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} used the werewolf as a shield, the couple of times he moved in.  As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike.  It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point.

With all of the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons realized they were being ignored, and started to get up and make a run for the exits.  Some of were uninjured, some were in shock, and others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury.  It was pure pandemonium.  And still {{extra.daimon.hero}} watched these combatants fling each other around and try to kill each other.   Something kept him locked in place though, he wasn't afraid per se but he was looking at the fight in a more analytical view, more studious, almost .... judgmental.

Just then, they crashed into a huge stone reliefs of one of the winged 'Annunaki', which was one of the ancient Mesopotamian gods.  Stone chunks were flung around the room, and priceless artifacts instantly became dust and debris.  A haze of dust and smoke was starting to fill the room, and {{extra.daimon.hero}} heard a light chime, like some metal or crystal near the floor coming his way.  Catching his eye as it slid toward him, was a large sapphire gem of the deepest royal blue he'd ever seen.

Another crash resounded around the room, more violent than the last, and {{extra.daimon.hero}} knew he needed to move now.   As he moved to get up, and turned for the side emergency fire exit, he reached out and grabbed the gem.  A mild electric shock traveled up his arm and stopped his movements.   But that wasn't what had him locked in place and blinking furiously.   He was clearly hearing words that he should NOT be hearing.

`What.  The Hell.  Is going on?`

Another roar echoed from the combatants, and this time, without looking back, {{extra.daimon.hero}} moved and continued his escape out the museum.  Presumptively, he thought,

`Thank God I drive a tank.`

The scene outside the museum was what you'd expect it to be.  One expensive localized disaster.  In some ways, it resembled someone kicking over an ant hill.   The well-dressed patrons and donors and museum staff all running and hustling in multiple directions at once.   The sound of police sirens and fire engines could now be heard off in the background but steadily gaining strength and closing the distance.   {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} pulled out his keys, turned the alarm off, and jumped in his truck.  The adrenaline from the escape was now starting to come down and exhaustion was creeping in.   

`OK, Food and Hot shower before I start to really freak out.`

{{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} pulled onto the street and sped away from the scene as fast as he could.  He didn't care about speeding or getting a ticket.   All the attention was focused behind him, with every emergency service vehicle moving in that direction.  

He turned onto Interstate I-95, and started driving northbound, driving virtually on auto-pilot to get home as fast as possible.  Numb, unaware of how much time had passed, he finally walked in the door of his home, and the events of that evening started to reply in his mind.   Grabbing some pemmican bars he kept for hiking out of the pantry, he tore into them, sat down and thought on all that had happened.   

`This is crazy.  Who were those guys?  What did they want?  And ... wait a minute, what the hell happened to that gem I grabbed?`

`What the...`

And {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} slipped into oblivion.
