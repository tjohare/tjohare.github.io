# Chapter 2

Thankfully, I wasn't the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'.  

The entire situation however, was a front-and-center, in-your-face rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though.  {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} and the Werewolf were locked hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor.  Violently and explosively.

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} was holding his own though, I'd give him that.  The axe-wielding murder partner though couldn't get close to them yet, as {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} used the werewolf as a shield the couple of times he moved in.  As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike.  It was just a matter of time at this point.

With the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons started to get up and make a run for the exits.  Some were uninjured, others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury.  It was pandemonium.  And still I watched these combatants trying to kill other.   Something kept me locked in place, not afraid but more analytical and almost ....judgmental.
