# Chapter 2

Thankfully, {{extra.daimon.hero}} was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'.  

The entire situation however, was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though.  {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} and the Werewolf were locked togther hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor.  Violently and explosively crashing into them.

{{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} was holding his own though, {{extra.daimon.hero}} would give him that.  The werewolf's axe-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as {{extra.daimon.insurance_client_name}} used the werewolf as a shield the couple of times he moved in.  As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike.  It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point.

With all of the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons realized they were being ignored, and started to get up and make a run for the exits.  Some of were uninjured, some in shock, and others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury.  It was pure pandemonium.  And still {{extra.daimon.hero}} watched these combatants trying to kill other.   Something kept him locked in place, he wasn't afraid per se but was looking at the fight in a more analytical view, almost ....judgmental.

Just then, they crashed into a stone relief of one of the winged 'Annunaki', which was one of the ancient Mesopotamian gods.  Stone chunks were flung around the room, and priceless artifacts instantly became dust and debris.  A haze was starting to fill the room, and {{extra.daimon.hero}} heard a light chime, like some metal or chime near the floor coming his way.  Catching his eye, was a large sapphire gem of the deepest royal blue he'd ever seen.

Another crash resounded around the room and {{extra.daimon.hero}} knew he needed to move now.   As he moved to get up, and turned for the side emergency fire exit, he grabbed the gem and an electric shock traveled up his arm.   But that wasn't what had him blinking furiously.   He was clearly hearing words that he should NOT be hearing.

`What.  The Hell.  Is going on?`

Another roar echoed from the combatants, and without looking back, {{extra.daimon.hero}} continued his escape out the museum.  Again, he thought, `Thank God I drive a tank.`
