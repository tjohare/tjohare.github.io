# Chapter 2 - AI Introduction

Sometime later, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} woke.   Ravenously hungry and de-hydrated, he began to pick himself up off the floor.  He climbed back up on the couch, and grabbed the water bottle he picked up earlier and chugged it completely.   After a few seconds, he needed more.

Moving to the kitchen, he re-filled the water bottle from the fridge's water dispenser, and chugged that too.   

!!! info "Careful.  You want to make sure you keep that in your system. Smaller sips would prove more beneficial."

`Who am I hearing?  Oh Crap, Am I going crazy?`

!!! info "No, you are not having a psychotic episode.  You do remember the bonding announcement, correct?"

`Sort of.  You sure I'm not crazy?`

!!! info "Yes I'm sure.  I am an artificial entity created for the purpose of teaching the descendants of Enki about their heritage and unlocking their potential.  Most of the bloodline were hidden for years, even when Enki and his brother were still here, because too many others feared their power.  Enki was a little... vigorous when it came to having kids."

`So, what's my potential?  Well, I mean, my mom always said that my potential was hidden deep down and you won't really know your potential unless you push yourself in the face of adversity.`

!!! info "Your mother was absolutely correct."

`Ugh. Oh goody.  Just...  don't tell her that, OK?  I'll never hear the end of it.`

!!! info "So, the hunger and dehydration are side effects of some of the genetic modifications that are still ongoing, though most of it is done.  You have been unconscious for approximately 24 hours."

`WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME??!!`

!!! info "I've unlocked your daimonic progression levels.  We will be training to increase your body's power, strength, coordination, and endurance, as well as focusing your mental acuity on both psychic energy and elemental manipulation."

`Um... Demonic progression....`

!!! info "Incorrect.  DAIMONIC.  From the ancient Greek 'δαίμων', which meant 'godlike, power or fate'.  Daimons were seen as lesser deities or guiding spirits and could be either good or evil.  Or both.  Depending on their attitude."

`OK, we'll be training.   Um, why do we need to train?  And what about the mental focusing something...?`

!!! info "Correct.  We train so you are not killed by other Daimonic individual who are afraid of you.  Or what you will become. I mentioned this earlier?  Regardless, the mental aspects are the Psychic Energy and Elemental Manipulation skills."

`So I have magic or something now?`

!!! info "No, you have the ability to psychically interact with various Nanites that have been injected into your bloodstream.  The nanites are what's used for the DNA restructuring, as well as manipulating various energy frequencies.  Your body and system are creating more and more nanites as we speak.  That is some of the replication that is still ongoing.  And will be for some time."

`Oh. OK. Um, how many progression levels are there?`

!!! info "There are 5 established and recognized progression or refinement levels, with approximately 10 sub-stages per level.  These are Body, Mind, Spirit, Ascended, and Immortal, but it is unlikely you will reach the pinnacle in levels.  Too many outside variables and hostile actors and forces will try to prevent this from happening, but the first 3 levels should be very doable for you.  Especially with myself acting as a guide.  You should become quite powerful, if we are given the opportunity.  And you aren't killed."

`You're just a bundle of sunshine, aren't you?`

`Hey, what do I call you?`

!!! info "My name is {{extra.daimon.ai_name}}."

After a long shower and a double-portioned breakfast, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} called his office and asked to speak with Mary.  He figured no matter what the situation was or what happened to him, as long as he was ok, she'd want to make sure he was ok and everything.   

"Mary here, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}, is that you?  You OK?"

"Hey Mary, I'm good, not hurt.  Just... really messed up mentally on what happened the other night.   I crashed unbelievably hard.  I think my body needed it.  Sorry I didn't contact you sooner.   I think I just needed time.   ...Still do if I'm being honest," {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} replied with a heavy sigh.

"I'll let everyone here know you're ok.  We're glad you're not hurt, {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  Are you gonna go talk to a therapist or something?  I know I would need one."

"You just like to talk to people.  ...Actually Mary, I think I'm gonna take a break for a bit.  I saw some things that I'm having a hard time with.  I think I'm gonna take a leave of absence.  Take some time for myself.  Clear some things up."  {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}} paused.  "The application should be good to go, and I'm leaving the rest of it in your hands.  You're in charge, Mary.  I'll send an email or something to that effect so our staff and clients know."

"No worries {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  Just remember how much I took care of you during my performance review."

"Oh you're getting a nice fat raise, Mary.  I'll email payroll right after this call to make it official as well."

"Take care of yourself {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}, and call us if you need anything." After an extended pause, "I, um, might have family that understands some of what you're going through, if you need a non-medical person to speak to."

"I doubt it Mary, but thanks for looking out for me.  Call you soon."  {{extra.daimon.hero}} hung up.

`{{extra.daimon.ai_name}}, you there?`

!!! info "I will always be here {{extra.daimon.hero_nickname}}.  How can I help you?"

`We discussed training.  What do we need to do?  What's the plan?  DO YOU... have a plan?`

!!! info "First, since there are other Daimons actively hunting in this area, we should go somewhere remote, more isolated than here, so we are not discovered.  Do you have a location for this?"

`Maybe... We used to have a time-share near Grand Lake, Colorado.  It's really nice and quiet, very private but expensive to stay there.`

!!! info "That is not a problem.  Once we have enough control over our elemental manipulation and have sufficient energy reserves to start converting base metals, most of our issues should be resolved very quickly.  At least financially."

`Wait, you mean, like a Philosopher's stone and stuff...?  You mean like converting Lead into Gold?`

!!! info "Yes.  Or Palladium, or Rhodium, or anything really.  Although inert transition metals are easier to convert.  Less taxing energy wise.  But that's going to take a couple of weeks to get there."

`OK, I can do this.  I'll call and book the house now.  Nobody is there this time of year.  Too cold during the winter.`

!!! info "Also, I suggest driving there.  It gives us more options, allows for us to hide, if we are discovered.  Being stuck in a flying tube does not seem particularly safe to me."
