# Jeweled Lessons

{{daimon.hero}} also learned about The Jewel of Enki - the Blue sapphire embedded within {{daimon.hero_nickname}}.  It contains the memories and knowledge of many different martial styles, the techniques for improving elemental affinities, and the consolidated knowledge of enchanting items with affinities and runic constructs.

Most of that information was static, and consistent across generations - usually.  And the Jewels were said to grow with each bearer.  So what elese was stored?   Experiences.

Its purpose was to help the descendants become better leaders.   They would have a wealth of experience to deal with most developments, both politically and privately.

It stored experiences; memories.   Moments of success but more importantly, instances of failure.   Instances of Loss, of Defeat, of Lies.   And especially Betrayal.   The bearers experienced the full emotional pain of those instances.  

Blinding, crippling pain and loss.

It showed how they came about, how they were resolved, and if those resolutions were helpful.

The original creators and bearers of the jewels considered this important to remember.  The reason for this was two-fold.  First, it prepared the descendants that, without a doubt, somewhere in the future, a loved one would betray them.   And secondly, to learn how to possibly forgive and carry on.
