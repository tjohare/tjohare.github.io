# Chapter 4 -

_[Location: Mount Elbert, Colorado]_

Shortly after the 'incident', as it was being referred to in Grand Lake, the {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}s called for an emergency clan meet.  The 5 largest clans and their affiliate branches all showed up to the Mount Elbert clan hall.  

Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name15}}, Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name16}}, Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name17}}, and Clan {{extra.daimon.clan_name18}}.  The most powerful clans on the west coast of the United States.

And as with any group of powerful people, they smiled, they nodded, and they barely held off killing each other.  Eventually, they decided to just ignore each other.

Joseph {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}}, clan head and de facto Daimonic leader of North America, sat at a large round table, and brought the judge's gavel down on the wooden block before him.  The conversations tapered off as Joseph politely waited, ready to lay out the problem for them to address.

"Elders, we have a problem that needs to be addressed," Joseph announced to the room.

"I don't think so.  If this is about your son getting humiliated, then the problem is not the problem.  The problem is that you think YOUR problem is OUR problem," replied Seraphina {{extra.daimon.clan_name17}} smugly.

Joseph's head snapped to look at her and sneered, "Of course that would be **your** reply, lacking courage to face an adversary seems to be a {{extra.daimon.clan_name17}} trait."

"Why don't you explain to us WHY this affects us.  Looking at this from the outside, it appears to just be an internal issue to your people." replied Dara {{extra.daimon.clan_name18}}, gently laying a placating hand on Seraphina's shoulder to stop her from launching at the {{extra.daimon.clan_name14}} clan head.

"Though this should be obvious to a real leader, there are several reasons for a unified response.  First, the designated clan heir was viciously attacked unprovoked.  Unless you want your own heirs attacked unilaterally for some invisible perceived insult, a response is required.  Secondly, by all accounts, this individual took out 3 future clan leaders very quickly, but didn't kill them.  This could an agent for some other group trying to destabilize ours.   Or sow mistrust.  Or could be a terrorist.   Therefore, I call for a Wild Hunt to be invoked against this individual."
