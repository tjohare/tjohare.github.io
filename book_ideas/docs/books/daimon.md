    _The weather today was something that hooked and teased every single non-Florida native.   76Â° Degrees, bright & sunny with no rain nor clouds in sight.  And while not exactly beach tan worthy, it was certainly outdoor worthy for everyone.  Neighbors, co-workers, kids, one and all.   Nobody wanted to be inside, including myself, but that was just not meant to be._

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _How the chapters are going to be laid out._

        - However, The use of {{ extra.daimon.psy_energy_manip_life }} causes additional conflicts.   
        - Some will believe It should not have been unlocked without binding oaths and punishments.
        - The reason for the fear is that using {{ extra.daimon.psy_energy_manip_life }} and {{ extra.daimon.psy_energy_manip_psy }} can add the target's skillset to the originators.
