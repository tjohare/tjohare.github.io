# Daimon


The weather today was something that hooked and teased every single non-Florida native.   76 Degrees, bright & sunny with no rain nor clouds in sight.  And while not exactly beach tan worthy, it was certainly outdoor worthy for everyone.  Neighbors, co-workers, kids, one and all.   Nobody wanted to be inside, including myself, but that was just not meant to be.
