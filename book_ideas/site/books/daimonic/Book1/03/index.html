<p><em>[Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; Mikaela's POV]</em></p>
<p>Mikaela Silversteel was sweeping the general store.  Just as she did every day for the last four years, since her sixteenth birthday.  With shoulder length dirty blond hair and blue eyes, she was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11" and had a classically pretty face.  She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew.  She was however, very fit, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic' if anything.  Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart.   </p>
<p>Which contributed to her almost constant anger and soul-crushing sadness.</p>
<p>"Mikaela!  I need you to get my laundry done.   I'm running out of gym shirts and clothes to wear," coming out from the back room whined Malach Silversteel; who was the town bully, and general bane of her existence.  </p>
<p>Although Malach was also, her younger brother, and he inherited a great deal more power than Mikaela.  Even more so than most others in their clan.  As such, he was his father's favored son, the golden boy.  The next clan heir, just like their father.</p>
<p>And he lorded it over everyone.  Especially Mikaela.</p>
<p>"This is such bullshit," she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away.  "He's a bully and he's lazy.  He's going to get us and the clan into serious trouble some day.  I guarantee it."</p>
<p>The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi Goldwing.  Mikaela groaned.   "Great.  The evil minion twins too," she whispered.  She couldn't contain the sarcasm in her voice.</p>
<p>Turning to Malach, "Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to you," announced Sachi.  </p>
<p>"We were asked to bring you by real quick," replied Asher.  </p>
<p>Asher and Sachi Goldwing were Mikaela's cousins as well as fraternal brother-and-sister twins who did everything together, routinely finishing each other sentences.  And they were also known to share a malicious streak a mile wide.  They fawned over Malach, sucked up to him, and often helped him pick on others around the area.  </p>
<p>"Thanks, you two."  Malach turned to Mikaela, "I need you to get that laundry done, sis.  Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again.  I'd hate for you to be punished over something so trivial," he sneered to his sister.  </p>
<p>Frustrated, she just sighed.  She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on.  The anger and sadness within her grew.  As he walked off, she looked up, tears pooling in her eyes, and whispered, "Someday.  Someday I'll show them."</p>

<p><em>[Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; Dominick's POV]</em></p>
<p>Dom put the truck in park, turned the key off, and stepped out of the vehicle.  He realized that, in addition to the possible band-aids, he needed a few things and toiletries. The general store, while small, should have everything he needed.  </p>
<p>Opening the front door, Dom heard the bell chime.  Sitting at the check-out counter reading a hard cover novel was one of the prettiest girls, in Dom's opinion, he'd seen.  She was tall and lean, and intelligent looking as she focused on reading her novel.  The word that came to mind was 'fierce' after a while, when he was still looking at her.  Before his thoughts could continue though, he received a curious warning from Apkallu.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Be warned Dom.  She's a Daimon like you, but if I reading her energy correctly, she's very, very  underpowered.  She's possibly the clan's Omega.  She'd be a good opponent to work on.</p>
</div>
<p><code>OH Cool!  Maybe I could talk to her, and... wait... what do you mean "Clan's Omega?" I don't get that...</code></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">There's a lot of culture and backstory you're missing because you didn't grow up in this environment.  First, Daimonic society is based on strength and power.  The strong rule.  In many ways, Daimons are a lot like wolves.  They are predators.  The weakest member of the clan is the omega.  These members are routinely bullied or rejected, until they are forced out of the clan.  It reinforces the ideal of grow, or die.</p>
</div>
<p><code>Are you freakin' serious?!?  So it doesn't matter what she looks like, how smart she could be, or what her personality is, or... most importantly here, if she's a really good person or not.  If she's got no power, she gets crapped on?  By everyone?  Am I understanding what Omega means now?</code></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Correct.</p>
</div>
<p><code>That's some Bull. Shit.  And not just shortened to BS, that gets the whole damn word.</code></p>
<p><img alt="divider" src="../../../../assets/affinity_button_water.png" width="15%" /></p>
<p>Dominick quietly browsed through the aisles, mulling over what he had just learned from Kal.
The front door bell chimed once more and Dom looked up from his perusing.  </p>
<p>In walked 3 young adults, heading straight for blond-haired clerk he passed earlier.  They couldn't see him so he quietly watched what was going on.</p>
<p>"Hey Mikaela, I just heard you didn't finish cleaning up the ranch houses yesterday, like father asked you to.  You remember, the rental units that give the clan financial stability.  He's none to happy at the moment.  I told him I'd make sure you got it done immediately."  The young bully jeered at the blond clerk.  The other two young adults next to him, initially sniggered, but were now openly laughing along with the young bully.</p>
<p>"Malach, I wasn't told about them until the end of the day.  There was no way I could finish cleaning them.  I was goi-"</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence though, the bully backhanded her across the face.  Hard.  Calculating his reaction, Kal interjected.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Hold on Dom, be aware, they are all Daimons.  All from the same clan according to their DNA scans.  Hmm, the alpha is considerably more powerful than the girl.  He's about your strength currently but his available power level is significantly less than ours.  Much, Much smaller.  In fact, you could probably take all of them if you activate your abilities together.  But speed would be key here.  And it wouldn't last very long.</p>
</div>
<p><code>OK, lets prep Strength, Speed, Perception, and Skin hardening nanite subroutines.  Overlay some metal knuckle formations on the elemental enhancement side.  On my command.</code></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Nanites prepped and ready.   Enhancement programs standing by to activate.</p>
</div>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Dom stepped out, and walked toward the counter.  "Hey asshole, you like hitting girls.  Maybe I should give you a lesson in manners," Dom exclaimed as he stalked down the aisle towards the group, eyes focused on the one the clerk named Malach.</p>
<p>"Do you have any idea of who I am?  This is my store, get the hell out of here, Loser,"  Malach replied laughing, dismissing Dom as he approached.</p>
<p>"Asher, get rid him," Malach turned to face back to Mikaela, waving his hand to brush off the whole situation.</p>
<p>Asher grabbed Dominick by the arm, and motioned to steer him to the door.</p>
<p><code>Kal?  Activate.</code></p>
<p>Power flooded Dom's body.  It felt like an electric current going through his body, as his muscles grew more dense and powerful.  Time appeared to slow down a little bit as his speed and perception increased dramatically.  His skin thickened and became more dense, like leather.  He could see Mikaela's eyes start to widen in his time-accelerated state, recognition settling in for her.  </p>
<p>Breaking his grip, Dom planted a palm strike to the center of Asher's chest and watched him fly back into the wall.  Sachi, wide eyed and jaw hanging open, just stared at him, then at her brother in shock.  Until Asher groaned from the floor, not getting up right away.  She looked back at Dom and took a swing.  </p>
<p>Blocking her strike and grabbing her wrist, Dom used her momentum, and turned her into a full hip throw, tossing Sachi right back at her brother.  The twins crashed together in a heap just as Asher tried to get up, and now both twins were back on the floor, swaying and trying to clear their heads.  Both now out of the action.</p>
<p>Malach was utterly frozen, unmoving with the biggest eyes Dominick had ever seen.  He watched unbelieving, as the event played out in front of him.  Both of his cousins were taken out by an outsider.  Dom turned to Malach and said, "You ARE... going to be... my little bitch."</p>
<p>As if breaking the spell over him, rage came over on Malach's face, and he took a wild haymaker swing at Dom.  Dom blocked and, while Malach's arm was hyper extended, he snapped the elbow easily.  Malach screamed in pain, and tried to take another swing with the other arm.   Again, Dom blocked with the other arm and then snapped that elbow too.  Fear and Pain overwhelmed him, and as Malach's screams rose in both octave and volume, Dom finally gut punched him, then kneed him to the face to silence him.</p>
<p>Dom looked down on his fallen foe.  Malach wasn't moving.</p>
<p>Dom finally turned to Mikaela and softly asked, "You ok?"</p>
<p>Staring at Dom wide eyed, she finally shrieked, "YOU ATTACKED MY BROTHER!!"  Dom snorted.</p>
<p>"If that's your family, your family sucks."</p>
<p>That statement seemed to deflate her, and she sank down in her chair.  A sense of finality and despair seemed to engulf her.  After a few seconds, she whispered, "They are going to take it out on me when you leave."  </p>
<p>Dom studied her, finally reaching out and touched her where Malach had back handed her.   Pushing healing energy into her face, Dom replied, "You are not alone.  If you need friend, I'm staying at the old 'Higant' house on the lake."  Then softly added, "And I don't have any friends, not like us."</p>
<p>Dom smiled sadly, turned, and walked out the store's front door.  </p>
<p>Awe and wonder dominated Mikaela's face.  She couldn't believe what just happened.  Someone had stood up to her brother.  Stood up for her.  Even more shocking, he was a healer.  There hadn't been a healer since she could remember.  It had to have been generations since the last healer.   </p>
<p>She didn't know what her clan would do.   Would they seek revenge for Malach's beat down and humiliation?  Or would they seek to tie him to the clan in some way as a healer?  She had no clue.  Should she even tell them he was a healer.</p>
<p>Hell, thinking back to his offer, she didn't know what she wanted either.</p>
<p>But Maybe.  Hopefully.  She had at least started to make a friend.  She wasn't sure though.</p>
<p>She didn't have any friends either.</p>
<p><img alt="divider" src="../../../../assets/affinity_button_wind.png" width="15%" /></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Foolish.  You let her know where we are staying.  If she betrays us to her clan, they will come down on us in force.  You do not have the power, nor the experience to survive an encounter like that.  You've put yourself in danger unnecessarily.</p>
</div>
<p><code>I thought of that.   But... It WAS necessary.  It was necessary for me, for my soul, for my mental well being.  I needed to make sure I'm still going to do the right thing when everything else goes to crap.  And you're forgetting something very important.  You said we'll eventually be found.  If she doesn't tell anyone where we are, we'll know without a doubt she can be trusted.  And that made it worth it.</code></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Not completely worth it.  We still didn't pick up the supplies and toiletries we initially went there for.</p>
</div>
<p><code>Damnit!!</code></p>
