URL can be found here: https://tjohare.github.io/book_ideas/site/ Authors I follow Here's some authors I follow: William D. Arand 1 William D Arand is a GameLit author best known for his unique stories. The talented author holds a day job that takes care of his bills and only writes in his free time. However, he has managed to create an impressive readership, and currently, he has over 20 published works to his name. Daniel Schinhofen 2 The American writer Daniel Schinhofen is an extremely well regarded author within his particular field, largely concerning himself with gaming in fiction. This is where literature role-playing games, or LITRPG as it\u2019s more commonly known, comes in, making for an interactive reading experience for his audience. Michael Anderle 3 Michael Anderle is a noteworthy author hailing from America, who is famous for writing science fiction, paranormal, and fantasy books. He is particularly well known for writing and publishing the Kurtherian Gambit book series. Author Anderle was born in the year 1967 in Houston, Texas. Jim Butcher 4 Well known fantasy author Jim Butcher is highly regarded thanks to his popular series of novels \u2018The Dresden Files\u2019 as well as the \u2018Codex Alera\u2019 saga. All this has helped secure him a place as a New York Times best-selling author. What type of Protagonist & Situation Pure Magical This character has gained some degree of magical ability or knowledge, outside of the norm for current reality. Pseudo-Magical (via Technology) A technology-based ability that's appears so advanced that an outsider would mistakenly conclude it could be magically based. ie. Teletechnics are an example of this. 5 Pure Technology An ability that showcased by some type of technology attached or assigned to the user, such as some type of futuristic armor or weapon. Time Period Is this based on current time period now ( ie. year 2021 ) Is this based on some ancient time period ( ie. pre-renaissance and musket, 14 th Century ) Is there some other type of Steampunk-variable time period, or some type of blend? What is the Conflict / Resolution that needs to be handled? No conflict or resolution required. You are just lost in the sauce. Prophetic based structure - somehow you are the chosen one to fulfill the prophecy and end the bad guys. Escaping something else and decide to take a stand here and now.

Variable Type Content pretty function ( var_list, rows, header, e ) Default mkdocs_macro Prettify a dictionary or object (used for environment documentation, or debugging). Builtin Jinja2 Filters These filters are provided by Jinja2 as a standard. See also the Jinja2 documentation on builtin filters ). Variable Type Content abs builtin_function_or_method Return the absolute value of the argument. attr function ( environment, obj, name, value ) Get an attribute of an object. foo|attr(\"bar\") works like foo.bar just that always an attribute is returned and items are not looked up. batch function ( value, linecount, fill_with, tmp, item ) A filter that batches items. It works pretty much like slice just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this is used to fill up missing items. See this example. capitalize function ( s ) Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase. center function ( value, width ) Centers the value in a field of a given width. count builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. d function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. default function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. dictsort function ( value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func ) Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Because python dicts are unsorted you may want to use this function to order them by either key or value. e builtin_function_or_method escape(s) -> markup escape builtin_function_or_method escape(s) -> markup filesizeformat function ( value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit ) Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB, 4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc). Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega, Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to True the binary prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi). first function ( environment, seq ) Return the first item of a sequence. float function ( value, default ) Convert the value into a floating point number. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( environment, value, attribute, expr ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, indentfirst, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( eval_ctx, value, d, attribute, do_escape, idx, item ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( value ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, seq, func, item ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value, verbose ) Pretty print a variable.

The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( value, slices, fill_with, seq, length, items_per_slice, slices_with_extra, offset, slice_number, start, end, tmp ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method soft_unicode(object) -> string striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( environment, iterable, attribute, start ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, policies, rv ) Converts URLs in plain text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( _eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumper, options ) Dumps a structure to JSON so that it's safe to use in <script> tags. It accepts the same arguments and returns a JSON string. Note that this is available in templates through the |tojson filter which will also mark the result as safe. Due to how this function escapes certain characters this is safe even if used outside of <script> tags.","title":"Macro info"},{"location":"macro_info/#macros-plugin-environment","text":"","title":"Macros Plugin Environment"},{"location":"macro_info/#general-list","text":"All available variables and filters within the macros plugin: Variable Type Content extra dict social = [{'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/facebook-square', 'link': 'https://www.facebook.com/edward.ohare.jr'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/twitter', 'link': 'https://twitter.com/gdistortions'}, {'icon': 'fontawesome/brands/instagram', 'link': 'https://www.instagram.com/tjohare/'}], daimon [ dict ] config Config config_file_path = 'E:\\\\TJ Scans and files\\\\tjohare.github.io\\\\book_ideas\\\\mkdocs.yml', site_name = 'Book Ideas', nav [ NoneType ], pages [ NoneType ], site_url = 'https://tjohare.github.io/book_ideas/site', site_description = 'All Book Ideas', site_author = \"TJ O'Hare\", theme [ Theme ], docs_dir = 'E:\\\\TJ Scans and files\\\\tjohare.github.io\\\\book_ideas\\\\docs', site_dir = 'E:\\\\TJ Scans and files\\\\tjohare.github.io\\\\book_ideas\\\\site', copyright = 'Copyright \u00a9 2021 TJ OHare', google_analytics [ NoneType ], dev_addr [ Address ], use_directory_urls = True, repo_url = '', repo_name = '', edit_uri = '', extra_css = ['stylesheets/extra.css'], extra_javascript = ['https://unpkg.com/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js', 'javascripts/config.js', 'https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js'], extra_templates = [], markdown_extensions = ['toc', 'tables', 'fenced_code', 'meta', 'def_list', 'attr_list', 'admonition', 'codehilite', 'footnotes', 'pymdownx.arithmatex', 'pymdownx.betterem', 'pymdownx.caret', 'pymdownx.critic', 'pymdownx.details', 'pymdownx.emoji', 'pymdownx.inlinehilite', 'pymdownx.magiclink', 'pymdownx.mark', 'pymdownx.smartsymbols', 'pymdownx.snippets', 'pymdownx.highlight', 'pymdownx.superfences', 'pymdownx.tasklist', 'pymdownx.tilde'], mdx_configs [ dict ], strict = False, remote_branch = 'gh-pages', remote_name = 'origin', extra [ SubConfig ], plugins [ PluginCollection ] environment dict system = 'Windows', system_version = '10', python_version = '3.9.2', mkdocs_version = '1.1.2', macros_plugin_version = '0.5.5', jinja2_version = '2.11.3' plugin Config module_name = 'main', modules = [], include_dir = 'custom', include_yaml = ['custom/daimon.yml'], j2_block_start_string = '', j2_block_end_string = '', j2_variable_start_string = '', j2_variable_end_string = '', verbose = False git dict status = True, date [ datetime ], short_commit = '98919f2', commit = '98919f2b0afc4f63223bc5cd761781f9070569fa', author = 'tjohare', tag = '', date_ISO = '2021-03-28 09:57:08 -0400', message = 'shortened {{extra.daimon. to {{daimon.', raw = 'commit 98919f2b0afc4f63223bc5cd761781f9070569fa\\nAuthor: tjohare \\nDate: Sun Mar 28 09:57:08 2021 -0400\\n\\n shortened {{extra.daimon. to {{daimon.', root_dir = 'E:/TJ Scans and files/tjohare.github.io' context function ( obj, e ) Default mkdocs_macro List the defined variables macros_info function ( ) Test/debug function: list useful documentation on the mkdocs_macro environment. now function ( ) Get the current time (returns a datetime object).

The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, indentfirst, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter.

The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( eval_ctx, value, d, attribute, do_escape, idx, item ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( value ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, seq, func, item ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value, verbose ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( value, slices, fill_with, seq, length, items_per_slice, slices_with_extra, offset, slice_number, start, end, tmp ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method soft_unicode(object) -> string striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( environment, iterable, attribute, start ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0).

I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, policies, rv ) Converts URLs in plain text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width.

Daemon is the Latin word for the Ancient Greek of daimon ( \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd : \"god\", \"godlike\", \"power\", \"fate\"), which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit such as the daemons of ancient Greek religion and mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European daimon \"provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies), \" from the root da- \"to divide\". Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities, according to entry \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd at Liddell & Scott. Additionally, For reference, BCE is short for Before Common Era. The Common Era begins with year 1 in the Gregorian calendar and is also known as the Western or Christian calendar. The First \"Gods\" Generally the Oldest Deities are the Mesopotamian Gods.

Web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically. A lot was riding on this test run. His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent. They were a small, young team and every win counted. After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report. 15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl. You could have heard a pin drop. Application performing as expected for all tests. No errors found. Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around. The collective sigh of relief was palpable. Mary Galdur, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry. \"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer. First round is on me.\" Dominick said with a smile to the team. The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world. Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failed to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasingly complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time. Hell, what's the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe. Dominick chuckled as he thought to myself, he thought, I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements to suppress his libido. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the \"Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment\", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedestal near the walls. The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, Dominick spotted his target. \"Good evening, Mr. Reagan Addison. How are you tonight?\" asked Dominick. \"Ah, Good evening to you, Dominick. We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight. Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?\" he coolly asked. He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it. \"Actually, we finished tonight. All tests passing, and all requirements met. Ahead of schedule too, I might add,\" replied Dominick. The soft smile continued. \"I wanted to bring you the good news in person. All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate.\" \"Outstanding news, Dom. This does call for a toast.\" A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across Reagan Addison's face. No man should be that pretty. The one time Dom stopped by his firm's office, he noticed that everyone, LITERALLY everyone, in that office was gorgeous. Like it was some sort of unspoken corporate requirement for them to be good looking as well as intelligent. No shot at finding a girlfriend there, they're all out of my league. Sigh, at this rate, I'm gonna be single forever. Reagan Addison continues speaking, \"There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related. I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward. And Rich.\" My first thought is, \"It's not about the money.\" But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, \"When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money.\" Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like? \"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. Reagan Addison. I'm going to meet up with the rest of my coworkers to try to salvage the rest of my ni-\" An quick series of loud and bright explosions ripples out from the main entrance. There's not that much the way in damage, but the flash of temporary blindness and sharp ringing in our ears is a testament that something has gone catastrophically bad. \"GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR DIE!\" is heard loud and clear, repeated over and over to various huddled groups. This is quickly followed by the sounds of automatic gunfire. Dominick remained strangely calm throughout all this, and was quickly and smoothly getting down on the floor, as the robbery crew asked. But that's not what caught Dom's eye and held his attention. As Reagan Addison turned to face them, Dom swore he saw a silver-bluish aura surround Reagan Addison's form. Rage and Anger flashed in his eyes and a primal scream tore out of his throat. Reagan Addison charged his attackers, and they turned and fired upon him. It must have been the shock and confusion of the moment, because it appeared that none of the bullets fired seemed to hit Reagan Addison before he was upon them. And then it got ugly. I did't want to stare, but I just couldn't look away. Reagan Addison was breaking arms, and crushing faces. One of the rifleman literally had an indentation in his skull from a punch. I didn't know whether to cheer or throw up it was so vicious. And just when I thought it couldn't get more surreal, two other individuals slowly stalked into the room and it was like a bad horror movie come to life. One looked something like an armored version of Michael Myers, with his porcelain mask actually in a sneer and a blood-encrusted hand axe. The other was a god-damned werewolf, so lifelike I thought it had to be some sort of theme-park animatronic. But it was far too real and graceful for that. I don't think my psyche accepted what I was seeing. I'll never forget the first thought to run through my head on seeing them walk into the room. Huh, they'll let just about anyone in here... Reagan Addison looked at the newcomers with wild eyes and a pronounced sense of bloodlust, breathing heavier and heavier each passing second; and then he just charged them. The werewolf moved to intercept him and the Mike Myers character skirted around the side, appearing to flank him. 2 versus 1 is not good odds any day of the week, in any situation. Add to that, that one of the robbers was wielding an axe and the one individual we had on our side seemed to be out of his mind with rage, things looked rather grim. It was time to look for an exit strategy. Or as I've been routinely texted, from my development staff for staying late in the office, \"GTFO Dom\". Thankfully, Dominick was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'. The entire situation, however was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though. Reagan Addison and the Werewolf were locked together hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor. Violently and explosively crashing into them. Reagan Addison was holding his own though, Dominick would give him that. The werewolf's ax-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as Reagan Addison used the werewolf as a shield, the couple of times he moved in. As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike. It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point. With all of the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons realized they were being ignored, and started to get up and make a run for the exits. Some of were uninjured, some were in shock, and others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury. It was pure pandemonium. And still, Dominick watched these combatants fling each other around and try to kill each other. Something kept him locked in place though, he wasn't afraid per se but he was looking at the fight in a more analytical view, more studious, almost.... judgmental. Just then, they crashed into a huge stone relief of one of the winged 'Annunaki', which was one of the ancient Mesopotamian gods. Stone chunks were flung around the room, and priceless artifacts instantly became dust and debris. A haze of dust and smoke was starting to fill the room, and Dominick heard a light chime, like some metal or crystal near the floor coming his way. Catching his eye as it slid toward him, was a large sapphire gem of the deepest royal blue he'd ever seen. Another crash resounded around the room, more violent than the last, and Dominick knew he needed to move now. As he moved to get up and turned for the side emergency fire exit, he reached out and grabbed the gem. A mild electric shock traveled up his arm and stopped his movements. But that wasn't what had him locked in place and blinking furiously. He was clearly hearing words that he should NOT be hearing. Bloodline Genome confirmed. Trace biological patterns as well as mi{width=800}hondrial DNA and chloroplast DNA confirm ancestry to the required profile. Initiating molecular bonding of Daimonic AI now... what... What. The Hell. Is that? Another roar echoed from the combatants, and this time, without looking back, Dominick moved and continued his escape out the museum. Presumptively, he thought, I need to get outta here. Thank goodness I drive a tank. The scene outside the museum was what you'd expect it to be. One expensive localized disaster. In some ways, it resembled someone kicking over an ant hill. Well-dressed patrons, donors, museum staff, and clueless bystanders, all running and hustling in multiple directions at once. The sound of police sirens and fire engines could now be heard off in the background but steadily gaining strength and closing the distance. Dom pulled out his keys, turned the car alarm off, and jumped in his truck. The adrenaline from the escape was now starting to come down and exhaustion was creeping in. Turning the truck on, and running his hands through his hair, he started to prioritize. OK, Get home, Food and Hot shower, before I start to really freak out. Dom pulled onto the main street and sped away from the downtown scene as fast as he could. He didn't care about speeding or getting a ticket. It appeared that all the attention was focused behind him, with every emergency service vehicle moving in that direction. He turned onto Interstate I-95, and started driving northbound, driving virtually on auto-pilot to get home as fast as possible. After a while, numb, and unaware of how much time had passed, he finally walked in the door of his home, and the events of that evening started to replay in his mind. Grabbing some Nature Valley and pemmican bars he kept for hiking out of the pantry, he tore into them, sat down and thought on all that had happened tonight. This is crazy. Who were those guys? What did they want? And... hey, wait a minute, what the hell happened to that gem I grabbed? Daimonic AI bonding complete. DNA restructuring and genome modification commencing now... Pain wracked through his entire body. Everything felt as if it was on fire. His stomach violently twisted and he felt as if he was going to retch, throwing up his stomach contents. But a smooth deep voice dominated this mind. Hello Dominick. I hope you prove worthy... What ... And Dom slipped into oblivion.","title":"Chapter 1 - The Awakening"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter01/#chapter-1-the-awakening","text":"[Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL] Dominick watched the testing framework run.

Is that? Another roar echoed from the combatants, and this time, without looking back, Dominick moved and continued his escape out the museum. Presumptively, he thought, I need to get outta here. Thank goodness I drive a tank. The scene outside the museum was what you'd expect it to be. One expensive localized disaster. In some ways, it resembled someone kicking over an ant hill. Well-dressed patrons, donors, museum staff, and clueless bystanders, all running and hustling in multiple directions at once. The sound of police sirens and fire engines could now be heard off in the background but steadily gaining strength and closing the distance. Dom pulled out his keys, turned the car alarm off, and jumped in his truck. The adrenaline from the escape was now starting to come down and exhaustion was creeping in. Turning the truck on, and running his hands through his hair, he started to prioritize. OK, Get home, Food and Hot shower, before I start to really freak out. Dom pulled onto the main street and sped away from the downtown scene as fast as he could. He didn't care about speeding or getting a ticket. It appeared that all the attention was focused behind him, with every emergency service vehicle moving in that direction. He turned onto Interstate I-95, and started driving northbound, driving virtually on auto-pilot to get home as fast as possible. After a while, numb, and unaware of how much time had passed, he finally walked in the door of his home, and the events of that evening started to replay in his mind. Grabbing some Nature Valley and pemmican bars he kept for hiking out of the pantry, he tore into them, sat down and thought on all that had happened tonight. This is crazy. Who were those guys? What did they want? And... hey, wait a minute, what the hell happened to that gem I grabbed? Daimonic AI bonding complete. DNA restructuring and genome modification commencing now... Pain wracked through his entire body. Everything felt as if it was on fire. His stomach violently twisted and he felt as if he was going to retch, throwing up his stomach contents. But a smooth deep voice dominated this mind. Hello Dominick. I hope you prove worthy... What ... And Dom slipped into oblivion.","title":"Chapter 1 - The Awakening"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter02/","text":"Chapter 2 - AI Introduction Sometime later, Dom woke. Ravenously hungry and de-hydrated, he began to pick himself up off the floor. He climbed back up on the couch, and grabbed the water bottle he picked up earlier and chugged it completely. After a few seconds, he needed more. Moving to the kitchen, he re-filled the water bottle from the fridge's water dispenser, and chugged that too. Careful. You want to make sure you keep that in your system. Smaller sips would prove more beneficial. Who am I hearing? Oh Crap, Am I going crazy? No, you are not having a psychotic episode. You do remember the bonding announcement, correct? Sort of. I could hear.... something. You sure I'm not crazy? Yes I am sure. I am an artificial entity, an intelligent program, created for the purpose of teaching the descendants of Enki about their heritage and unlocking their potential. Most of the true bloodline were hidden for years, even when Enki and his brother were still here. Too many others feared their power and potential and started to wipe their descendants out. And Enki was known to be a little... vigorous when it came to having kids. Who's Enki? What's an Enki, that's a weird name. Wait, \"Descendants\"....are you saying I'm related, like my great grandfather or something? Yes, but for who he is, we can discuss that later on. Think of it this way, your genetics indicate you're descended from a very powerful individual, you've inherited some of his potential, and right now, we have to focus on developing out that potential. Which is significant, and you will be noticed very quickly. There are many who would want to control you. Or neutralize you. I'm so confused. OK, So, what's my potential? Well, I mean, my mom always said that my potential was hidden deep down and you won't really know your potential unless you push yourself in the face of adversity. Your mother was correct. Ugh. Just don't... don't tell her that, OK? I'll never hear the end of it, he grumbled. I feel exhausted. Like I've run a marathon and haven't eaten or drank anything in days. So, the hunger and dehydration are side effects of some of the genetic modifications that are still ongoing, though most of it is done. You have been unconscious for approximately 24 ho- Wait, wait... What... WHAT. HAVE. YOU. DONE??!! I've unlocked your daimonic power. We will be training to increase your body's power, strength, coordination, and endurance, as well as focusing your mental acuity on tapping into and controlling your elemental manipulation. Ok. Uh. Um... Demonic power.... Incorrect. DAIMONIC. From the ancient Greek '\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd', which meant 'godlike, power or fate'. Daimons were seen as lesser deities or guiding spirits in the ancient world and could be a power for either good or evil. Or both. Usually they were just obnoxious, depending on their attitude. If you need a comparison, think of the ancient demigods of mythology. Most of them were Daimons actually. So I have this \"daimonic\" power now? Precisely. Therefore, we need to start your training immediately. OK, we'll be training. Um, why do we need to train? And what was that about the mental focusing something...? We train so you are not killed by other Daimonic individuals who are afraid of you. Or rather, what you will become. I mentioned this earlier? Regardless, the mental aspects are the Elemental Manipulation skills. What The HELL??!? Someone's going to try to kill me? Take it Back!!! That is not possible anymore. The modifications are already well underway, and the nanites are almost fully integrated at this point. OK, ok, focus on what I can fix now. Ok, so I'll control all of this with my mind or something. Partially, you will eventually have the ability to psychically interact with various nanites that have been injected into your bloodstream. Your thoughts will influence the nano-machines, and dictate their response. The nanites are what's used for the genome restructuring, as well as manipulating various energy frequencies in the environment. Your body and system are creating more and more nanites as we speak. That is some of the replication that is still ongoing. And will be for some time. What's the likelihood of these others leaving me alone? Unlikely. That power, in both your physical changes as well as your elemental strength, will draw out others. You should become quite powerful, if we are given the opportunity. And you aren't killed. You're just a bundle of sunshine, aren't you? Hey, what do I call you? My name is Apkallu. After a long shower and a double-portioned breakfast, Dom called his office and asked to speak with Mary. He figured no matter what the situation was or what happened to him, as long as he was not bleeding out, she'd want to hear from him and make sure he was ok and everything. \"Mary here, ...Dom, is that you??!? Dom, Are you OK?!\" \"Hey Mary, I'm good, not hurt. Just... trying to make sense of everything, I think I'm really messed up mentally on what happened the other night. I crashed unbelievably hard. Pretty sure my body needed it. Sorry I didn't contact you sooner. I just needed time. ...Still do if I'm being honest,\" Dom replied with a heavy sigh. \"I'll let everyone here know you're ok. We heard and saw on the news some of what happened at the museum the other night and we knew you were headed there. A couple of us were a little freaked out when we didn't hear from you. We're glad you're not hurt, Dom. Are... are you gonna go talk to a therapist or something? Go to your doctor's? I know I would need one.\" \"Heh, you just want a reason to to talk to people. ...Actually Mary, I think I'm gonna take a break for a bit. A Sabbatical. I saw some things that I'm having a hard time with. I think I'm gonna take a leave of absence. Take some time for myself. Clear some things up.\" Dom paused. \"The platform should be good to go, and I'm leaving the rest of it in your hands. You're in charge, Mary. I'll send an email or something to that effect so our staff and clients know.\" \"No worries Dom. You're one of my oldest friends, we love you. Also, just remember how much I took care of you during my performance review.\" \"Oh you're getting a nice fat raise, Mary. I'll email payroll right after this call to make it official as well.\" \"Take care of yourself Dom, and call us if you need anything.\" After an extended pause, \"I, um, might have family that understands some of what you're going through, if you need a non-medical person to speak to.\" \"I really doubt that Mary, but thanks for looking out for me. Call you soon.\" And with that, Dominick hung up. Kal, you there? I will always be here Dominick. Have you shortened my name now? A gesture of familiarity and friendship? How can I help you Dom? Kal feels more natural for me. So, back on point, we discussed training. What do we need to do? What's the plan? Do YOU have a plan? First, since there are other Daimons actively hunting in this area, we should go somewhere remote, more isolated than here, so we are not discovered. Do you have a location we can use for this? Maybe... We used to have a time-share near Grand Lake, Colorado. It's really nice and quiet, especially during the winter months. Very private but expensive to stay there. That is not a problem. Once we have enough control over our elemental manipulation and have sufficient energy reserves to start converting base metals into rare earth elements, most of our issues should be resolved very quickly. At least financially. Wait, you mean, like a Philosopher's stone and stuff...? You mean like converting Lead into Gold? Dom replied wide-eyed and excitedly. Yes. Or Palladium, or Rhodium, or anything really. Although inert transition metals are easier to convert. Less taxing energy wise. But that's going to take a couple of weeks to get there. OK, I can do this. I'll call and book the house now. Nobody is usually there. Too cold the first of the year. Also, I suggest driving there. It gives us more options, allows for us to hide or react appropriately, if we are discovered. Being stuck in a flying tube does not seem particularly safe to me. Me neither, bud. Me neither. [Location: Grand Lake, Colorado] After nearly 3 days of driving, Dominick arrived at the rental home in Colorado. While Grand Lake itself was considered a tourist destination during the summer months, during the winter it tended to be more locals. However, Dominick's family had lived there quite a bit over the years. It shouldn't be a problem for him. It only tapered off after Dom's father passed away 3 years earlier. The house was decently sized and had no immediate neighbors to either side, but a truck and a boat for supplies was an absolute must for using the house. Fortunately Dom remembered that the local grocery store was very small, so he stopped in Granby to pick up most of the food supplies he'd need. Well stocked and finally settled in, Dom assessed the situation. This should work well. The area has limited access to humans, and plenty of wood, earth, and water elements for manipulation. Additionally, fire manipulation would benefit us against the cold weather. Plenty of food, decent shelter, and privacy. Yes, this should be more than adequate. You can get a little creepy my friend. Let's not get crazy yet. Ease into the training, yes? And I'm still human, thank you very much. Take my word, you are NOT entirely human anymore. Not sure I believe that... I mean, I know you're telling me I can do some things now, but I don't feel any different. I find your lack of faith... disturbing. A Star Wars quote? Seriously? HOW? He groaned. The museum had decent wi-fi... Sighing, OK, so what's first? Now, this is where you should be able to excel past your other contemporaries here, with me as your teacher. I am going to show you past training memories, reconstructions of ancient warlords, and various weapon masters and how they lived and fought. Their training regimens. Then we copy their movements and styles for now. After we've learned the basics and various styles, we'll start to combine them into our own style for maximum effectiveness. We will train every morning before sunrise, until noon. Followed by some refreshments, then we'll work on elemental software code constructs in the afternoon and early ev- Wait! wait, wait... code constructs? Wide-eyed, Dom whispered in awe. Yes, we'll need to do some coding in order to control the nanites to act as we wish. I will show you how it's done virtually. Don't forget, it is your nanites that enable you manipulate the environment. You do remember how to do Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism...Yes? As you have worked as a programmer before, this seemed an area where you might be the most comfortable. Was I wrong? No, not wrong. I just didn't expect software coding translated to Magic. That's... friggin' awesome!!! Dom said with a big smile. sigh, Coding does not translate to magic. Magic does not exist. You are merely programming the nanites in your system to behave in a certain way, under various trigger conditions. This is science and technology in it's purest, most pristine form. I am sooo gonna code me some fireballs. Ooo, maybe some lightning bolts. Its going to be a long, long day. For the first six days, the routine did not falter. Kal made sure Dom was up at 4:45am, as promised before dawn. The routine was to hydrate, stretch, run at least a mile if not more, then cooldown. After that, Dom would review and perform a form he learned the previous day, and then work on learning a new form. All while focused on pushing his nanites and energy to help his body grow stronger, rejuvenate faster. Dom recalled growing up, his father had been a 4 th degree black belt in Tang Soo Do. And while Dom learned some good self defense, he never pushed becoming a martial artist like some of his classmates did, wanting to be the next world champion or something like that. Those experiences however, helped him adjust to learning the new forms and techniques Kal was teaching him, very quickly. Some Dom realized, some of these forms and techniques were variations on modern styles, such as Aikido and Kung Foo. Others looked more... primal, almost animalistic. Then they moved onto the Elemental energy side of their training. The next set of exercises, and the foundation for most other external abilities, was the manifestation and pushing out of pure energy. It dealt with controlling the energy all around us, within ourselves and the universe. In some ways, it was its own form of meditation. Pure energy could be used for general healing and creating basic energy shields. Dom was told however, to not try to 'do anything' with them yet. Just focus on using the nanites to gather and pool the energy. This however, even with Kal's help and insight, took time. After another couple days though, Dominick's meditation and mental preparation finally paid off. And it appeared, the flood gates opened. Dom started with the fire element. He called it to him and pooled a small amount within his palm. About the size of a baseball. Then he 'pushed' or threw the energy toward a target. Visualization was the key here. Thenm, once he could hit his target with one element consistently, he would rotate onto another element, running through each elemental sphere as they were; Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Darkness, Nature, Crystal, and Metal. Eventually, he was told he could start combining various elements for a myriad of different effects, but for now, stay within a single elemental sphere when training. It was the end of the second week when they revisited some of the pure energy concepts. Today, we'll be covering new ground and discussing 'why' we did not touch healing or shielding yet. OK, I was wondering about that. Especially when, at least to me, was the most area to learn. What new ground are we covering? So, let's recap. We've pooled our energy, but it's a small amount. The amount of healing this could do is extremely small and limited. Maybe stop some bleeding. Heal a couple of scratches, probably not even all of them. What we would need to do is provide a 'constant flow' of pure healing energy to the target. Continuously replenishing the amount there. This continuous flow, is called channeling. So we can make how much we heal... variable, Dom replied. Channeling however, is also the fastest way to completely drain you of energy. And leave you completely weak and vulnerable. Hence, it's taught with an abundance of more caution. More of our kind has been killed or enslaved due to being energy deficient than any other action. Makes sense. He replied deep in thought. We'll add channeling to the training regimen for all your elemental affinities. Grab that knife over there by the kitchen. Now, you can stab yourself or some repeated cuts on your hand and forearms should be sufficient to practice your healing abilities. Rolling his eyes, Dom thought, Great. I'm pretty sure my therapist would be horrified by this conversation. I'm probably gonna need to go pick up some extra bandages, just in case.","title":"Chapter 2 - AI Introduction"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter02/#chapter-2-ai-introduction","text":"Sometime later, Dom woke.

Just as she did every day for the last four years, since her sixteenth birthday. With shoulder length dirty blond hair and blue eyes, she was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11\" and had a classically pretty face. She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew. She was however, very fit, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic' if anything. Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart. Which contributed to her almost constant anger and soul-crushing sadness. \"Micaela! I need you to get my laundry done. I'm running out of gym shirts and clothes to wear,\" coming out from the back room whined Malach Silversteel; who was the town bully, and general bane of her existence. Although Malach was also, her younger brother, and he inherited a great deal more power than Micaela. Even more so than most others in their clan. As such, he was his father's favored son, the golden boy. The next clan heir, just like their father. And he lorded it over everyone. Especially Micaela. \"This is such bullshit,\" she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away. \"He's a bully and he's lazy. He's going to get us and the clan into serious trouble some day. I guarantee it.\" The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi Goldwing. Micaela groaned. \"Great. The evil minion twins too,\" she whispered. She couldn't contain the sarcasm in her voice. Turning to Malach, \"Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to you,\" announced Sachi. \"We were asked to bring you by real quick,\" replied Asher. Asher and Sachi Goldwing were Micaela's cousins as well as fraternal brother-and-sister twins who did everything together, routinely finishing each other sentences. And they were also known to share a malicious streak a mile wide. They fawned over Malach, sucked up to him, and often helped him pick on others around the area. \"Thanks, you two.\" Malach turned to Micaela, \"I need you to get that laundry done, sis. Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again. I'd hate for you to be punished over something so trivial,\" he sneered to his sister. Frustrated, she just sighed. She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on. The anger and sadness within her grew. As he walked off, she looked up, tears pooling in her eyes, and whispered, \"Someday. Someday I'll show them.\" [Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; Dominick's POV] Dom put the truck in park, turned the key off, and stepped out of the vehicle. He realized that, in addition to the possible band-aids, he needed a few things and toiletries. The general store, while small, should have everything he needed. Opening the front door, Dom heard the bell chime. Sitting at the check-out counter reading a hard cover novel was one of the prettiest girls, in Dom's opinion, he'd seen. She was tall and lean, and intelligent looking as she focused on reading her novel. The word that came to mind was 'fierce' after a while, when he was still looking at her. Before his thoughts could continue though, he received a curious warning from Apkallu. Be warned Dom. She's a Daimon like you, but if I reading her energy correctly, she's very, very underpowered. She's possibly the clan's Omega. She'd be a good opponent to work on. OH Cool! Maybe I could talk to her, and... wait... what do you mean \"Clan's Omega?\" I don't get that... There's a lot of culture and backstory you're missing because you didn't grow up in this environment. First, Daimonic society is based on strength and power. The strong rule. In many ways, Daimons are a lot like wolves. They are predators. The weakest member of the clan is the omega. These members are routinely bullied or rejected, until they are forced out of the clan. It reinforces the ideal of grow, or die. Are you freakin' serious?!? So it doesn't matter what she looks like, how smart she could be, or what her personality is, or... most importantly here, if she's a really good person or not. If she's got no power, she gets crapped on? By everyone? Am I understanding what Omega means now? Correct. That's some Bull. Shit. And not just shortened to BS, that gets the whole damn word. Dominick quietly browsed through the aisles, mulling over what he had just learned from Kal. The front door bell chimed once more and Dom looked up from his perusing. In walked 3 young adults, heading straight for blond-haired clerk he passed earlier. They couldn't see him so he quietly watched what was going on. \"Hey Micaela, I just heard you didn't finish cleaning up the ranch houses yesterday, like father asked you to. You remember, the rental units that give the clan financial stability. He's none to happy at the moment. I told him I'd make sure you got it done immediately.\" The young bully jeered at the blond clerk. The other two young adults next to him, initially sniggered, but were now openly laughing along with the young bully. \"Malach, I wasn't told about them until the end of the day. There was no way I could finish cleaning them. I was goi-\" Before she could finish her sentence though, the bully backhanded her across the face. Hard. Calculating his reaction, Kal interjected. Hold on Dom, be aware, they are all Daimons. All from the same clan according to their DNA scans. Hmm, the alpha is considerably more powerful than the girl. He's about your strength currently but his available power level is significantly less than ours. Much, Much smaller. In fact, you could probably take all of them if you activate your abilities together. But speed would be key here. And it wouldn't last very long. OK, lets prep Strength, Speed, Perception, and Skin hardening nanite subroutines. Overlay some metal knuckle formations on the elemental enhancement side. On my command. Nanites prepped and ready. Enhancement programs standing by to activate. Taking a deep breath, Dom stepped out, and walked toward the counter. \"Hey asshole, you like hitting girls. Maybe I should give you a lesson in manners,\" Dom exclaimed as he stalked down the aisle towards the group, eyes focused on the one the clerk named Malach. \"Do you have any idea of who I am? This is my store, get the hell out of here, Loser,\" Malach replied laughing, dismissing Dom as he approached. \"Asher, get rid him,\" Malach turned to face back to Micaela, waving his hand to brush off the whole situation. Asher grabbed Dominick by the arm, and motioned to steer him to the door. Kal? Activate. Power flooded Dom's body. It felt like an electric current going through his body, as his muscles grew more dense and powerful. Time appeared to slow down a little bit as his speed and perception increased dramatically. His skin thickened and became more dense, like leather. He could see Micaela's eyes start to widen in his time-accelerated state, recognition settling in for her. Breaking his grip, Dom planted a palm strike to the center of Asher's chest and watched him fly back into the wall. Sachi, wide eyed and jaw hanging open, just stared at him, then at her brother in shock. Until Asher groaned from the floor, not getting up right away. She looked back at Dom and took a swing. Blocking her strike and grabbing her wrist, Dom used her momentum, and turned her into a full hip throw, tossing Sachi right back at her brother. The twins crashed together in a heap just as Asher tried to get up, and now both twins were back on the floor, swaying and trying to clear their heads. Both now out of the action. Malach was utterly frozen, unmoving with the biggest eyes Dominick had ever seen. He watched unbelieving, as the event played out in front of him. Both of his cousins were taken out by an outsider. Dom turned to Malach and said, \"You ARE... going to be... my little bitch.\" As if breaking the spell over him, rage came over on Malach's face, and he took a wild haymaker swing at Dom. Dom blocked and, while Malach's arm was hyper extended, he snapped the elbow easily. Malach screamed in pain, and tried to take another swing with the other arm. Again, Dom blocked with the other arm and then snapped that elbow too. Fear and Pain overwhelmed him, and as Malach's screams rose in both octave and volume, Dom finally gut punched him, then kneed him to the face to silence him. Dom looked down on his fallen foe. Malach wasn't moving. Dom finally turned to Micaela and softly asked, \"You ok?\" Staring at Dom wide eyed, she finally shrieked, \"YOU ATTACKED MY BROTHER!!\" Dom snorted. \"If that's your family, your family sucks.\" That statement seemed to deflate her, and she sank down in her chair. A sense of finality and despair seemed to engulf her. After a few seconds, she whispered, \"They are going to take it out on me when you leave.\" Dom studied her, finally reaching out and touched her where Malach had back handed her. Pushing healing energy into her face, Dom replied, \"You are not alone. If you need friend, I'm staying at the old 'Higant' house on the lake.\" Then softly added, \"And I don't have any friends, not like us.\" Dom smiled sadly, turned, and walked out the store's front door. Awe and wonder dominated Micaela's face. She couldn't believe what just happened. Someone had stood up to her brother. Stood up for her. Even more shocking, he was a healer. There hadn't been a healer since she could remember. It had to have been generations since the last healer. She didn't know what her clan would do. Would they seek revenge for Malach's beat down and humiliation? Or would they seek to tie him to the clan in some way as a healer? She had no clue. Should she even tell them he was a healer. Hell, thinking back to his offer, she didn't know what she wanted either. But Maybe. Hopefully. She had at least started to make a friend. She wasn't sure though. She didn't have any friends either. Foolish. You let her know where we are staying. If she betrays us to her clan, they will come down on us in force. You do not have the power, nor the experience to survive an encounter like that. You've put yourself in danger unnecessarily. I thought of that. But... It WAS necessary. It was necessary for me, for my soul, for my mental well being. I needed to make sure I'm still going to do the right thing when everything else goes to crap. And you're forgetting something very important. You said we'll eventually be found. If she doesn't tell anyone where we are, we'll know without a doubt she can be trusted. And that made it worth it. Not completely worth it. We still didn't pick up the supplies and toiletries we initially went there for.

Just as she did every day for the last four years, since her sixteenth birthday. With shoulder length dirty blond hair and blue eyes, she was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11\" and had a classically pretty face. She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew. She was however, very fit, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic' if anything. Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart. Which contributed to her almost constant anger and soul-crushing sadness. \"Micaela!

With only slightly less backstabbing. Joseph Silversteel, clan head and de facto Daimonic leader of North America's Western hemisphere, sat at a large round table, and brought the judge's gavel down on the wooden block before him. The conversations around the room tapered off as Joseph politely waited, ready to lay out the reason for the meet. \"Elders, we have a problem that needs to be addressed,\" Joseph announced to the room. \"A week ago, several clan heirs were brutally attacked in our territory. We need to formalize our response.\" \"I don't think so, Joseph. If this is just about your son getting humiliated, then the problem you called us for, is not the problem. The problem is that you think YOUR problem is OUR problem,\" replied Seraphina Whitespear smugly. Joseph's head snapped to look at her and sneered, \"Of course that would be your reply, lacking courage to face an adversary seems to be a Whitespear trait.\" Clan members on both sides began to rise. \"Why don't you explain to us WHY this affects us, Joseph. Looking at this from the outside, it appears to be an internal issue to just your people. How does this affect the clans?\" replied Dara Heartshield, gently laying a placating hand on Seraphina's shoulder, and to stop her from launching across the table at the Silversteel clan head. \"Though I would have thought this should be obvious to a real leader, there are several reasons for a unified response,\" replied Joseph, getting in a cheap shot. \"First, the designated clan heir was viciously attacked, unprovoked no less. Unless you want your own heirs attacked unilaterally for some invisible perceived insult by any outside party, a response is required. Secondly, by all accounts, this individual took out 3 future clan leaders with extensive combat experience very quickly, but didn't kill them. This could be an agent for some other group or power trying to destabilize ours from within. Or sow mistrust. Or they could be a terrorist. Either way, they need to be found and answer for their crimes. A balancing response to their transgression.\" \"Extensive combat experience my ass,\" quietly muttered Seraphina. \"What did you have in mind,\" asked Dara looking around the room. \"I call for a Wild Hunt to be invoked.\" Absolute silence engulfed the room. The remaining clan leaders were stunned by the request. \"There hasn't been a Wild Hunt in hundreds of years. It's usually invoked for murderers and betrayers!
