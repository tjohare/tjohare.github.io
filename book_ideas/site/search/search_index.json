The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically. A lot was riding on this test run. His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent. They were a small, young team and every win counted. After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report. 15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl. You could have heard a pin drop. Application performing as expected for all tests. No errors found. Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around. The collective sigh of relief was palpable. Mary Galdur, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry. \"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer. First round is on me.\" Dominick said with a smile to the team. The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world. Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time. Hell, what's the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe. Dominick chuckled as he thought to myself, he thought, I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements to suppress his libido. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the \"Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment\", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls. The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, Dominick spotted his target. \"Good evening, Mr. Reagan Addison. How are you tonight?\" asked Dominick. \"Ah, Good evening to you, Dominick. We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight. Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?\" he coolly asked. He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it. \"Actually, we finished tonight. All tests passing, and all requirements met. Ahead of schedule too, I might add,\" replied Dominick. The soft smile continued. \"I wanted to bring you the good news in person. All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate.\" \"Outstanding news, Dom. This does call for a toast.\" A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across Reagan Addison's face. No man should be that pretty. The one time Dom stopped by his firm's office, he noticed that everyone, LITERALLY everyone, in that office was gorgeous. Like it was some sort of unspoken corporate requirement for them to be good looking as well as intelligent. No shot at finding a girlfriend here. Quite frankly, it's disheartening. Reagan Addison continues speaking, \"There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related. I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward. And Rich.\" My first thought is, \"It's not about the money.\" But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, \"When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money.\" Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like? \"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. Reagan Addison. I'm going to meet up with the rest of my coworkers to try to salvage the rest of my ni-\" An quick series of loud and bright explosions ripples out from the main entrance. There's not that much the way in damage, but the flash of temporary blindness and sharp ringing in our ears is a testament that something has gone catastrophically bad. \"GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR DIE!\" is heard loud and clear, repeated over and over to various huddled groups. This is quickly followed by the sounds of automatic gunfire. Dominick remained strangely calm throughout all this, and was quickly and smoothly getting down on the floor, as the robbery crew asked. But that's not what caught Dom's eye and held his attention. As Reagan Addison turned to face them, Dom swore he saw a silver-bluish aura surround Reagan Addison's form. Rage and Anger flashed in his eyes and a primal scream tore out of his throat. Reagan Addison charged his attackers, and they turned and fired upon him. It must have been the shock and confusion of the moment, because it appeared that none of the bullets fired seemed to hit Reagan Addison before he was upon them. And then it got ugly. I did't want to stare, but I just couldn't look away. Reagan Addison was breaking arms, and crushing faces. One of the rifleman literally had an indentation in his skull from a punch. I didn't know whether to cheer or throw up it was so vicious. And just when I thought it couldn't get more surreal, two other individuals slowly stalked into the room and it was like a bad horror movie come to life. One looked something like an armored version of Michael Myers, with his porcelain mask actually in a sneer and a blood-encrusted hand axe. The other was a god-damned werewolf, so lifelike I thought it had to be some sort of theme-park animatronic. But it was far too real and graceful for that. I don't think my psyche accepted what I was seeing. I'll never forget the first thought to run through my head on seeing them walk into the room. This is ridiculous. I'm never going to a museum again. Reagan Addison looked at the newcomers with wild eyes and a pronouced sense of bloodlust, breathing heavier and heavier each passing second; and then he just charged them. The werewolf moved to intercept him and the Mike Myers character skirted around the side, appearing to flank him. 2 versus 1 is not good odds any day of the week, in any situation. Add to that, that one of the robbers was wielding an axe and the one individual we had on our side seemed to be out of his mind with rage, things looked rather grim. It was time to look for an exit strategy. Or as I've been routinely texted, from my development staff for staying late in the office, \"GTFO Dom\". Thankfully, Dominick was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'. The entire situation, however was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though. Reagan Addison and the Werewolf were locked together hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor. Violently and explosively crashing into them. Reagan Addison was holding his own though, Dominick would give him that. The werewolf's ax-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as Reagan Addison used the werewolf as a shield, the couple of times he moved in. As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike. It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point. With all of the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons realized they were being ignored, and started to get up and make a run for the exits. Some of were uninjured, some were in shock, and others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury. It was pure pandemonium. And still, Dominick watched these combatants fling each other around and try to kill each other. Something kept him locked in place though, he wasn't afraid per se but he was looking at the fight in a more analytical view, more studious, almost.... judgmental. Just then, they crashed into a huge stone relief of one of the winged 'Annunaki', which was one of the ancient Mesopotamian gods. Stone chunks were flung around the room, and priceless artifacts instantly became dust and debris. A haze of dust and smoke was starting to fill the room, and Dominick heard a light chime, like some metal or crystal near the floor coming his way. Catching his eye as it slid toward him, was a large sapphire gem of the deepest royal blue he'd ever seen. Another crash resounded around the room, more violent than the last, and Dominick knew he needed to move now. As he moved to get up and turned for the side emergency fire exit, he reached out and grabbed the gem. A mild electric shock traveled up his arm and stopped his movements. But that wasn't what had him locked in place and blinking furiously. He was clearly hearing words that he should NOT be hearing. Trace biological patterns and mitochondrial DNA confirm ancestry to the required bloodline profile. Initiating molecular bonding of Daimonic AI now... What. The Hell. Is going on? Another roar echoed from the combatants, and this time, without looking back, Dominick moved and continued his escape out the museum. Presumptively, he thought, Thank God I drive a tank. The scene outside the museum was what you'd expect it to be. One expensive localized disaster. In some ways, it resembled someone kicking over an ant hill. Well-dressed patrons, donors, museum staff, and clueless bystanders, all running and hustling in multiple directions at once. The sound of police sirens and fire engines could now be heard off in the background but steadily gaining strength and closing the distance. Dom pulled out his keys, turned the car alarm off, and jumped in his truck. The adrenaline from the escape was now starting to come down and exhaustion was creeping in. Turning the truck on, and running his hands through his hair, he started to prioritize. OK, Get home, Food and Hot shower, before I start to really freak out. Dom pulled onto the main street and sped away from the downtown scene as fast as he could. He didn't care about speeding or getting a ticket. It appeared that all the attention was focused behind him, with every emergency service vehicle moving in that direction. He turned onto Interstate I-95, and started driving northbound, driving virtually on auto-pilot to get home as fast as possible. After a while, numb, and unaware of how much time had passed, he finally walked in the door of his home, and the events of that evening started to replay in his mind. Grabbing some Nature Valley and pemmican bars he kept for hiking out of the pantry, he tore into them, sat down and thought on all that had happened tonight. This is crazy. Who were those guys? What did they want? And... hey, wait a minute, what the hell happened to that gem I grabbed? Daimonic AI bonding complete. DNA restructuring and gene therapy commencing now... Pain wracked through his entire body. Everything felt as if it was on fire. His stomach violently twisted and he felt as if he was going to retch, throwing up his stomach contents. But a smooth deep voice dominated this mind. Hello Dominick. I hope you prove worthy... What ... And Dom slipped into oblivion.","title":"Chapter 1 - The Awakening"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter1/#chapter-1-the-awakening","text":"[Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL] Dominick watched the testing framework run. The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically. A lot was riding on this test run. His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent. They were a small, young team and every win counted. After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report. 15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl. You could have heard a pin drop. Application performing as expected for all tests. No errors found. Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around. The collective sigh of relief was palpable. Mary Galdur, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry. \"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer. First round is on me.\" Dominick said with a smile to the team. The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world. Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time. Hell, what's the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe. Dominick chuckled as he thought to myself, he thought, I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements to suppress his libido. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the \"Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment\", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls. The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, Dominick spotted his target. \"Good evening, Mr. Reagan Addison. How are you tonight?\" asked Dominick. \"Ah, Good evening to you, Dominick. We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight. Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?\" he coolly asked. He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it. \"Actually, we finished tonight. All tests passing, and all requirements met. Ahead of schedule too, I might add,\" replied Dominick. The soft smile continued. \"I wanted to bring you the good news in person. All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate.\" \"Outstanding news, Dom. This does call for a toast.\" A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across Reagan Addison's face. No man should be that pretty. The one time Dom stopped by his firm's office, he noticed that everyone, LITERALLY everyone, in that office was gorgeous. Like it was some sort of unspoken corporate requirement for them to be good looking as well as intelligent. No shot at finding a girlfriend here. Quite frankly, it's disheartening. Reagan Addison continues speaking, \"There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related. I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward. And Rich.\" My first thought is, \"It's not about the money.\" But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, \"When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money.\" Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like? \"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. Reagan Addison. I'm going to meet up with the rest of my coworkers to try to salvage the rest of my ni-\" An quick series of loud and bright explosions ripples out from the main entrance. There's not that much the way in damage, but the flash of temporary blindness and sharp ringing in our ears is a testament that something has gone catastrophically bad. \"GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR DIE!\" is heard loud and clear, repeated over and over to various huddled groups. This is quickly followed by the sounds of automatic gunfire. Dominick remained strangely calm throughout all this, and was quickly and smoothly getting down on the floor, as the robbery crew asked. But that's not what caught Dom's eye and held his attention. As Reagan Addison turned to face them, Dom swore he saw a silver-bluish aura surround Reagan Addison's form. Rage and Anger flashed in his eyes and a primal scream tore out of his throat. Reagan Addison charged his attackers, and they turned and fired upon him. It must have been the shock and confusion of the moment, because it appeared that none of the bullets fired seemed to hit Reagan Addison before he was upon them. And then it got ugly. I did't want to stare, but I just couldn't look away. Reagan Addison was breaking arms, and crushing faces. One of the rifleman literally had an indentation in his skull from a punch. I didn't know whether to cheer or throw up it was so vicious. And just when I thought it couldn't get more surreal, two other individuals slowly stalked into the room and it was like a bad horror movie come to life. One looked something like an armored version of Michael Myers, with his porcelain mask actually in a sneer and a blood-encrusted hand axe. The other was a god-damned werewolf, so lifelike I thought it had to be some sort of theme-park animatronic. But it was far too real and graceful for that. I don't think my psyche accepted what I was seeing. I'll never forget the first thought to run through my head on seeing them walk into the room. This is ridiculous. I'm never going to a museum again. Reagan Addison looked at the newcomers with wild eyes and a pronouced sense of bloodlust, breathing heavier and heavier each passing second; and then he just charged them. The werewolf moved to intercept him and the Mike Myers character skirted around the side, appearing to flank him. 2 versus 1 is not good odds any day of the week, in any situation. Add to that, that one of the robbers was wielding an axe and the one individual we had on our side seemed to be out of his mind with rage, things looked rather grim. It was time to look for an exit strategy. Or as I've been routinely texted, from my development staff for staying late in the office, \"GTFO Dom\". Thankfully, Dominick was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'. The entire situation, however was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though. Reagan Addison and the Werewolf were locked together hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor. Violently and explosively crashing into them. Reagan Addison was holding his own though, Dominick would give him that. The werewolf's ax-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as Reagan Addison used the werewolf as a shield, the couple of times he moved in. As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike. It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point.

Ravenously hungry and de-hydrated, he began to pick himself up off the floor. He climbed back up on the couch, and grabbed the water bottle he picked up earlier and chugged it completely. After a few seconds, he needed more. Moving to the kitchen, he re-filled the water bottle from the fridge's water dispenser, and chugged that too. Careful. You want to make sure you keep that in your system. Smaller sips would prove more beneficial. Who am I hearing? Oh Crap, Am I going crazy? No, you are not having a psychotic episode. You do remember the bonding announcement, correct? Sort of. You sure I'm not crazy? Yes I am sure. I am an artificial entity created for the purpose of teaching the descendants of Enki about their heritage and unlocking their potential. Most of the bloodline were hidden for years, even when Enki and his brother were still here, because too many others feared their power. Enki was a little... vigorous when it came to having kids. Who's Enki? What's an Enki, that's a weird name. Wait, \"Descendants\"....are you saying I'm related, like my great grandfather or something? Yes, but for who he is, we can discuss that later on. Right now, we have to focus on developing out your potential. Which is significant, and you will be noticed very quickly. There are many who would want to control you or be with you. OK, So, what's my potential? Well, I mean, my mom always said that my potential was hidden deep down and you won't really know your potential unless you push yourself in the face of adversity. Your mother was absolutely correct. Ugh. Great. Just... don't tell her that, OK? I'll never hear the end of it, he grumbled. So, the hunger and dehydration are side effects of some of the genetic modifications that are still ongoing, though most of it is done. You have been unconscious for approximately 24 hours. Wait... What... WHAT. HAVE. YOU. DONE??!! I've unlocked your daimonic progression levels. We will be training to increase your body's power, strength, coordination, and endurance, as well as focusing your mental acuity on both psychic energy and elemental manipulation. Um... Demonic progression.... Incorrect. DAIMONIC. From the ancient Greek '\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd', which meant 'godlike, power or fate'. Daimons were seen as lesser deities or guiding spirits and could be either good or evil. Or both. Depending on their attitude. OK, we'll be training. Um, why do we need to train? And what was that about the mental focusing something...? We train so you are not killed by other Daimonic individuals who are afraid of you. Or what you will become. I mentioned this earlier? Regardless, the mental aspects are the Psychic Energy and Elemental Manipulation skills. Awesome, so I have magic or something now? No, you have the ability to psychically interact with various nanites that have been injected into your bloodstream. The nanites are what's used for the DNA restructuring, as well as manipulating various energy frequencies in the environment. Your body and system are creating more and more nanites as we speak. That is some of the replication that is still ongoing. And will be for some time. Oh. OK. Um, how many progression levels are there? It is unlikely you will reach the last stage of refinement. Too many outside variables and hostile actors and forces will try to prevent this from happening, but the first couple of levels should be very doable for you. Especially with myself acting as a guide. You should become quite powerful, if we are given the opportunity. And you aren't killed. You're just a bundle of sunshine, aren't you? Hey, what do I call you? My name is Apkallu. After a long shower and a double-portioned breakfast, Dom called his office and asked to speak with Mary. He figured no matter what the situation was or what happened to him, as long as he was not bleeding out, she'd want to hear from him and make sure he was ok and everything. \"Mary here, ...Dom, is that you? Are you OK?\" \"Hey Mary, I'm good, not hurt. Just... really messed up mentally on what happened the other night. I crashed unbelievably hard. I think my body needed it. Sorry I didn't contact you sooner. I think I just needed time. ...Still do if I'm being honest,\" Dom replied with a heavy sigh. \"I'll let everyone here know you're ok. We're glad you're not hurt, Dom. Are you gonna go talk to a therapist or something? I know I would need one.\" \"You just like to talk to people. ...Actually Mary, I think I'm gonna take a break for a bit. I saw some things that I'm having a hard time with. I think I'm gonna take a leave of absence. Take some time for myself. Clear some things up.\" Dom paused. \"The application should be good to go, and I'm leaving the rest of it in your hands. You're in charge, Mary. I'll send an email or something to that effect so our staff and clients know.\" \"No worries Dom. Just remember how much I took care of you during my performance review.\" \"Oh you're getting a nice fat raise, Mary. I'll email payroll right after this call to make it official as well.\" \"Take care of yourself Dom, and call us if you need anything.\" After an extended pause, \"I, um, might have family that understands some of what you're going through, if you need a non-medical person to speak to.\" \"I really doubt that Mary, but thanks for looking out for me. Call you soon.\" And with that, Dominick hung up. Kal, you there? I will always be here Dominick. Have you shortened my name now? A gesture of familiarity and friendship? How can I help you Dom? Kal feels more natural for me. So, back on point, we discussed training. What do we need to do? What's the plan? Do YOU have a plan? First, since there are other Daimons actively hunting in this area, we should go somewhere remote, more isolated than here, so we are not discovered. Do you have a location we can use for this? Maybe... We used to have a time-share near Grand Lake, Colorado. It's really nice and quiet, especially during the winter months. Very private but expensive to stay there. That is not a problem. Once we have enough control over our elemental manipulation and have sufficient energy reserves to start converting base metals into rare earth elements, most of our issues should be resolved very quickly. At least financially. Wait, you mean, like a Philosopher's stone and stuff...? You mean like converting Lead into Gold? Dom replied wide-eyed and excitedly. Yes. Or Palladium, or Rhodium, or anything really. Although inert transition metals are easier to convert. Less taxing energy wise. But that's going to take a couple of weeks to get there. OK, I can do this. I'll call and book the house now. Nobody is usually there. Too cold the first of the year. Also, I suggest driving there. It gives us more options, allows for us to hide or react appropriately, if we are discovered. Being stuck in a flying tube does not seem particularly safe to me. Me neither, bud. Me neither. [Location: Grand Lake, Colorado] After nearly 3 days of driving, Dominick arrived at the rental home in Colorado. While Grand Lake itself was considered a tourist destination during the summer months, during the winter it tended to be more locals. However, Dominick's family had lived there quite a bit over the years. It shouldn't be a problem for him. It only tapered off after Dom's father passed away 3 years earlier. The house was decently sized and had no immediate neighbors to either side, but a truck and a boat for supplies was an absolute must for using the house. Fortunately Dom remembered that the local grocery store was very small, so he stopped in Granby to pick up most of the food supplies he'd need. Well stocked and finally settled in, Dom assessed the situation. This should work well. The area has limited access to humans, and plenty of wood, earth, and water elements for manipulation. Additionally, fire manipulation would benefit us against the cold weather. Plenty of food, decent shelter, and privacy. Yes, this should be more than adequate. You can get a little creepy my friend. Let's not get crazy yet. Ease into the training, yes? And I'm still human, thank you very much. Take my word on this. You are NOT entirely human anymore. Not sure I believe that... I mean, I know I can do some things now, but I don't feel any different. I find your lack of faith... disturbing. Star Wars quote? Seriously? HOW? He groaned. The museum had decent wi-fi... Sighing, OK, so what's first? Now, this is where you should be able to excel past your other contemporaries here, with me as your teacher. I am going to show you past training memories, reconstructions of ancient warlords, and various weapon masters and how they lived and fought. Then we copy their movements and styles for now. This, along with some physical conditioning will start us on the Physical Enhancement Path. Every morning before sunrise, until noon. Followed by some refreshments, then we'll work on elemental code constructs in the afternoon and early even- Wait! wait, wait, code constructs? Wide-eyed, Dom whispered in awe. Yes, we'll need to do some coding in order to control the nanites to act as we wish. Its your nanites and psychic potential that enable you manipulate the environment. You do remember how to do Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism...Yes? As you have worked as a programmer before, this seemed an area where you might be the most comfortable. Was I wrong? No, not wrong. I just didn't expect software coding translated to Magic. That's... wicked cool. Dom said with a big smile. sigh, Coding does not translate to magic. Magic does not exist. You are merely programming the nanites in your system to behave in a certain way, under various trigger conditions. This is science and technology in it's purest form. I am sooo gonna code me some fireballs. Ooo, maybe some lightning bolts. It's all fun and training until someone loses an eye. For the first six days, the routine did not falter. Kal made sure Dom was up at 4:45am, as promised before dawn. First, they worked on strengthening his body overall, or as Kal called it, The Physical Enhancement Path, separate from the Body Progression Levels Kal discussed earlier. The routine was to hydrate, stretch, run 1 mile, then cooldown. After that, Dom would review and perform a form he learned the previous day, and then work on learning a new form. All while focused one pushing his nanites and his energy to help his body grow stronger, faster. Growing up, his father had been a 4 th degree black belt in Tang Soo Do, and while Dom learned some good self defense, he never pushed it like some of his classmates did, wanting to be the next world champion or something like that. Those experiences however, helped him adjust to learning the new forms Kal was teaching him, very quickly. The next set of exercises, and the foundation for most other external psychic abilities, was the manifestation and pushing out of pure energy. Kal called this the Elemental Enhancement Path. It dealt with controlling the energy all around us, within ourselves and the universe. Pure energy could be used for general healing and creating shields. Dom was told however, to not try to 'do anything' with them yet. Just focus on using the nanites to pool the energy. Fortunately, with Kal's help and insight, Dominick comprehended this concept very quickly, and moved onto specific elemental energy types. Dom starting with the fire element. He called it to him and pooled a small amount within his palm. About the size of a baseball. Then he 'pushed' or threw the energy toward a target. Once he could hit his target with one element consistently, he would rotate onto another element, running through each elemental sphere as they were; Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Darkness, Nature, Crystal, and Metal. It was the seventh day, where they revisited some of the pure energy concepts. Today, we'll be covering new ground and discussing 'why' we did not touch healing or shielding. OK, I was wondering about that. What new ground are we covering? So, let's recap. We've pooled our energy, but it's a small amount. The amount of healing this could do is extremely small and limited. Maybe stop some bleeding. Not even all of it. What we would need to do is provide a 'constant flow' of pure healing energy to the target. Continuously replenishing the amount there. This continuous flow, is called channeling. So we can make how much we heal... variable, Dom replied deep in thought. Channeling however, is also the fastest way to completely drain you of energy. And leave you completely weak and vulnerable. Hence, it's taught with an abundance of more caution. More of our kind has been killed or enslaved due to being energy deficient than any other action. Makes sense. He replied with a smirk. We'll add channeling to the training regimen for all your elemental affinities. Now, some pin pricks or repeated exacto-blade cuts on your hand and forearms should be sufficient to practice your healing abilities. Rolling his eyes, Dom thought, Great. I'm pretty sure my therapist would be horrified by this conversation. I'm probably gonna need to go pick up some extra bandages, just in case.","title":"Chapter 2 - AI Introduction"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter2/#chapter-2-ai-introduction","text":"Sometime later, Dom woke.

The nanites are what's used for the DNA restructuring, as well as manipulating various energy frequencies in the environment. Your body and system are creating more and more nanites as we speak. That is some of the replication that is still ongoing. And will be for some time. Oh. OK. Um, how many progression levels are there? It is unlikely you will reach the last stage of refinement. Too many outside variables and hostile actors and forces will try to prevent this from happening, but the first couple of levels should be very doable for you. Especially with myself acting as a guide. You should become quite powerful, if we are given the opportunity. And you aren't killed. You're just a bundle of sunshine, aren't you? Hey, what do I call you? My name is Apkallu. After a long shower and a double-portioned breakfast, Dom called his office and asked to speak with Mary. He figured no matter what the situation was or what happened to him, as long as he was not bleeding out, she'd want to hear from him and make sure he was ok and everything. \"Mary here, ...Dom, is that you? Are you OK?\" \"Hey Mary, I'm good, not hurt. Just... really messed up mentally on what happened the other night. I crashed unbelievably hard. I think my body needed it. Sorry I didn't contact you sooner. I think I just needed time. ...Still do if I'm being honest,\" Dom replied with a heavy sigh. \"I'll let everyone here know you're ok. We're glad you're not hurt, Dom. Are you gonna go talk to a therapist or something? I know I would need one.\" \"You just like to talk to people. ...Actually Mary, I think I'm gonna take a break for a bit. I saw some things that I'm having a hard time with. I think I'm gonna take a leave of absence. Take some time for myself. Clear some things up.\" Dom paused. \"The application should be good to go, and I'm leaving the rest of it in your hands. You're in charge, Mary. I'll send an email or something to that effect so our staff and clients know.\" \"No worries Dom. Just remember how much I took care of you during my performance review.\" \"Oh you're getting a nice fat raise, Mary. I'll email payroll right after this call to make it official as well.\" \"Take care of yourself Dom, and call us if you need anything.\" After an extended pause, \"I, um, might have family that understands some of what you're going through, if you need a non-medical person to speak to.\" \"I really doubt that Mary, but thanks for looking out for me. Call you soon.\" And with that, Dominick hung up. Kal, you there? I will always be here Dominick. Have you shortened my name now? A gesture of familiarity and friendship? How can I help you Dom? Kal feels more natural for me. So, back on point, we discussed training. What do we need to do? What's the plan? Do YOU have a plan? First, since there are other Daimons actively hunting in this area, we should go somewhere remote, more isolated than here, so we are not discovered. Do you have a location we can use for this? Maybe... We used to have a time-share near Grand Lake, Colorado. It's really nice and quiet, especially during the winter months. Very private but expensive to stay there. That is not a problem. Once we have enough control over our elemental manipulation and have sufficient energy reserves to start converting base metals into rare earth elements, most of our issues should be resolved very quickly. At least financially. Wait, you mean, like a Philosopher's stone and stuff...? You mean like converting Lead into Gold? Dom replied wide-eyed and excitedly. Yes. Or Palladium, or Rhodium, or anything really. Although inert transition metals are easier to convert. Less taxing energy wise. But that's going to take a couple of weeks to get there. OK, I can do this. I'll call and book the house now. Nobody is usually there. Too cold the first of the year. Also, I suggest driving there. It gives us more options, allows for us to hide or react appropriately, if we are discovered. Being stuck in a flying tube does not seem particularly safe to me. Me neither, bud. Me neither. [Location: Grand Lake, Colorado] After nearly 3 days of driving, Dominick arrived at the rental home in Colorado. While Grand Lake itself was considered a tourist destination during the summer months, during the winter it tended to be more locals. However, Dominick's family had lived there quite a bit over the years. It shouldn't be a problem for him. It only tapered off after Dom's father passed away 3 years earlier. The house was decently sized and had no immediate neighbors to either side, but a truck and a boat for supplies was an absolute must for using the house. Fortunately Dom remembered that the local grocery store was very small, so he stopped in Granby to pick up most of the food supplies he'd need. Well stocked and finally settled in, Dom assessed the situation. This should work well. The area has limited access to humans, and plenty of wood, earth, and water elements for manipulation. Additionally, fire manipulation would benefit us against the cold weather. Plenty of food, decent shelter, and privacy. Yes, this should be more than adequate. You can get a little creepy my friend. Let's not get crazy yet. Ease into the training, yes? And I'm still human, thank you very much. Take my word on this. You are NOT entirely human anymore. Not sure I believe that... I mean, I know I can do some things now, but I don't feel any different. I find your lack of faith... disturbing. Star Wars quote? Seriously? HOW? He groaned. The museum had decent wi-fi... Sighing, OK, so what's first? Now, this is where you should be able to excel past your other contemporaries here, with me as your teacher. I am going to show you past training memories, reconstructions of ancient warlords, and various weapon masters and how they lived and fought. Then we copy their movements and styles for now. This, along with some physical conditioning will start us on the Physical Enhancement Path. Every morning before sunrise, until noon. Followed by some refreshments, then we'll work on elemental code constructs in the afternoon and early even- Wait! wait, wait, code constructs? Wide-eyed, Dom whispered in awe. Yes, we'll need to do some coding in order to control the nanites to act as we wish. Its your nanites and psychic potential that enable you manipulate the environment. You do remember how to do Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism...Yes? As you have worked as a programmer before, this seemed an area where you might be the most comfortable. Was I wrong? No, not wrong. I just didn't expect software coding translated to Magic. That's... wicked cool. Dom said with a big smile. sigh, Coding does not translate to magic. Magic does not exist. You are merely programming the nanites in your system to behave in a certain way, under various trigger conditions. This is science and technology in it's purest form. I am sooo gonna code me some fireballs. Ooo, maybe some lightning bolts. It's all fun and training until someone loses an eye. For the first six days, the routine did not falter. Kal made sure Dom was up at 4:45am, as promised before dawn. First, they worked on strengthening his body overall, or as Kal called it, The Physical Enhancement Path, separate from the Body Progression Levels Kal discussed earlier. The routine was to hydrate, stretch, run 1 mile, then cooldown. After that, Dom would review and perform a form he learned the previous day, and then work on learning a new form. All while focused one pushing his nanites and his energy to help his body grow stronger, faster. Growing up, his father had been a 4 th degree black belt in Tang Soo Do, and while Dom learned some good self defense, he never pushed it like some of his classmates did, wanting to be the next world champion or something like that. Those experiences however, helped him adjust to learning the new forms Kal was teaching him, very quickly. The next set of exercises, and the foundation for most other external psychic abilities, was the manifestation and pushing out of pure energy. Kal called this the Elemental Enhancement Path. It dealt with controlling the energy all around us, within ourselves and the universe. Pure energy could be used for general healing and creating shields. Dom was told however, to not try to 'do anything' with them yet. Just focus on using the nanites to pool the energy. Fortunately, with Kal's help and insight, Dominick comprehended this concept very quickly, and moved onto specific elemental energy types. Dom starting with the fire element. He called it to him and pooled a small amount within his palm. About the size of a baseball. Then he 'pushed' or threw the energy toward a target. Once he could hit his target with one element consistently, he would rotate onto another element, running through each elemental sphere as they were; Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Darkness, Nature, Crystal, and Metal. It was the seventh day, where they revisited some of the pure energy concepts. Today, we'll be covering new ground and discussing 'why' we did not touch healing or shielding. OK, I was wondering about that. What new ground are we covering? So, let's recap. We've pooled our energy, but it's a small amount. The amount of healing this could do is extremely small and limited. Maybe stop some bleeding. Not even all of it. What we would need to do is provide a 'constant flow' of pure healing energy to the target. Continuously replenishing the amount there. This continuous flow, is called channeling. So we can make how much we heal... variable, Dom replied deep in thought. Channeling however, is also the fastest way to completely drain you of energy. And leave you completely weak and vulnerable. Hence, it's taught with an abundance of more caution. More of our kind has been killed or enslaved due to being energy deficient than any other action. Makes sense. He replied with a smirk. We'll add channeling to the training regimen for all your elemental affinities. Now, some pin pricks or repeated exacto-blade cuts on your hand and forearms should be sufficient to practice your healing abilities. Rolling his eyes, Dom thought, Great. I'm pretty sure my therapist would be horrified by this conversation. I'm probably gonna need to go pick up some extra bandages, just in case.","title":"Chapter 2 - AI Introduction"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter3/","text":"Chapter 3 - Pride & Prejudice [Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; Micaela's POV] Micaela Silversteel was sweeping the general store. She was generally considered tall for a woman at 5'11\" and classically pretty. Dirty blond hair and blue eyes. She didn't have supermodel looks, or a traffic stopping figure like some of the other girls she knew, but she was very fit though, with a runner's lean physique, and would best be described as 'athletic'. Where she was different however, than most of her friends and family, was that she was exceptionally smart. Which contributed to her constant anger and soul-crushing sadness. \"Micaela! I need you to get my laundry done. I'm running out of gym shirts to wear,\" whined Malach Silversteel, her younger brother, town bully, and general bane of her existence. Although Malach was her younger brother, he inherited a great deal more daimonic power than Micaela. More so than most others in their clan. As such, he was the favored son, the golden boy. And he lorded it over everyone. \"This is such bullshit,\" she muttered to herself as she moved to put the broom away. \"He's a bully and he's lazy. He's going to get us into trouble some day. I guarantee it.\" The front-door bell rang indicating its opening and in walked her cousins, Asher and Sachi Goldwing. Micaela groaned. \"Great. The evil minion twins too.\" She couldn't contain the sarcasm in her voice. Turning to Malach, \"Sorry Cuz, but your father and the elders want to speak to you,\" announced Sachi. \"We were asked to bring you by real quick,\" replied Asher. Asher and Sachi Goldwing were fraternal brother-and-sister twins who did everything together and routinely finished each other sentences. And they were also known to share a malicious streak a mile wide. They fawned all over Malach, and often helped him pick on others around the area. \"Thanks, you two.\" Malach turned to Micaela, \"I need you to get that laundry done, sis. Don't make me speak to father about you failing your clan duties again. I'd hate for you to be whipped.,\" he sneered to his sister. She didn't respond to his comment, it didn't help and honestly he would just use it as an excuse to do something horrible later on. The anger and sadness within her grew. As he walked off, she looked up, tears pooling in her eyes, and whispered, \"Someday. Someday I'll show them.\" [Location: Grand Lake, Colorado; Dominick's POV] Dom put the truck in park, turned the key off, and stepped out of the vehicle. He realized that, in addition to the possible band-aids, he needed a few things and toiletries. The general store, while small, should have everything he needed. Opening the front door, Dom heard the bell chime. Sitting at the check-out counter reading a hard cover novel was one of the prettiest girls, in Dom's opinion, had ever seen. She was tall and lean, and intelligent looking. The word that came to mind was 'fierce' when he was looking at her. Before his thoughts could continue though, he received a curious warning from Apkallu. Be warned Dom. She's a Daimon like you, but if I reading her energy correctly, she's very, very underpowered. She's possibly the clan's Omega. She'd be a good opponent to work on. Wait... what do you mean \"Clan's Omega?\" I don't get that... There's a lot of culture and backstory you're missing because you didn't grow up in this environment. First, Daimonic society is based on strength and power. The strong rule. In many ways, Daimons are a lot like wolves. They are predators. The weakest member of the clan is the omega. These members are routinely bullied or rejected, forced out of the clan. It reinforces the ideal of grow, or die. Are you freakin' serious?!? So it doesn't matter what she looks like, how smart she could be, or what her personality is, or... most importantly here, if she's a really good person or not. If she's got no power, she gets crapped on? By everyone? Am I understanding what Omega means now? Correct. That's some Bull. Shit. And not just shortened to BS, that gets the whole damn word. Dominick quietly browsed through the aisles, mulling over what he had just learned from Kal. The front door bell chimed once more and Dom looked up from his perusing. In walked 3 young adults, heading straight for blond-haired clerk he passed earlier. They couldn't see him so he quietly watched what was going on. \"Hey Micaela, I just heard you didn't finish cleaning up the ranch houses yesterday, like father asked you to. You remember, the rental units that give the clan financial stability. He's none to happy at the moment. I told him I'd make sure you got it done immediately.\" The young bully jeered at the blond clerk. The other two young adults next to him, initially sniggered, but were now openly laughing along with the young bully. \"Malach, I wasn't told about them until the end of the day. There was no way I could finish cleaning them. I was goi-\" Before she could finish her sentence though, the bully backhanded her across the face. Hard. Calculating his reaction, Kal interjected. Dom, they are all Daimons. All from the same clan according to their DNA. Hmm, the alpha is considerably more powerful than the girl. He's about your strength currently but his power well is significantly smaller than ours. Much, Much smaller. And he's only on the physical enhancement path. In fact, you could probably take all of them if you activate your Healing, Physical and Elemental Enhancements together. But speed would be key here. It wouldn't last very long. OK, activate Muscle hardening for now, just in case. Lets prep Strength, Speed, Perception, and Skin hardening on the body enhancement side. Go metal knuckle formations on the elemental enhancement side. On my command. Nanites prepped and ready. Enhancement programs standing by to activate. \"Hey asshole, you like hitting girls. Maybe I should make you my bitch,\" Dom exclaimed as he stalked down the aisle towards the group, eyes focused on the one the clerk named Malach. \"Do you have any idea of who I am? This is my store, you can get the hell out of here, Loser,\" Malach replied, dismissing Dom as he approached. \"Asher, get rid of my light work,\" Malach turned to face back to Micaela, waving his hand to dismiss the whole situation. Asher grabbed Dominick by the arm, and moved to steer him to the door. Kal? Activate. Power flooded Dom's body. It felt like an electric current going to his body, as his muscles grew more dense and powerful. Time appeared to slow down a little bit as his speed and perception increased dramatically. His skin thickened and became more dense, like leather. He could see Micaela's eyes start to widen in his time-accelerated state, recognition settling in for her. Dom planted a palm strike to the center of Asher's chest and watched him fly back into the wall. Sachi, wide eyed and jaw hanging open, just stared at him, then at her brother in shock. Until Asher groaned from the floor, not getting up right away. She looked back at Dom and took a swing. Grabbing her wrist and using her momentum, Dom turned her into a full hip throw and tossed Sachi right back at her brother. The twins crashed together in a heap as Asher tried to get up, and now both of them were back on the floor, swaying and trying to clear their heads. Both now out of the action. Malach was frozen, unmoving with the biggest eyes Dominick had ever seen. He watched unbelieving, as the event played out in front of him. Both of his gang were taken out by an outsider. Dom turned to Malach and said, \"You ARE... going to be... my little bitch.\" As if breaking the spell over him, rage came over on Malach's face, and he took a wild haymaker swing at Dom. Dom blocks and, while Malach's arm is hyper extended, he snapped the elbow easily. Malach screamed in pain, and tried to take another swing with the other arm. Again, Dom blocked and then snapped that elbow too. Fear and Pain overwhelmed him, and as Malach's screams rose in both octave and volume, Dom finally gut punched him, then kneed him to the face to silence him. Dom looked down on his fallen foe. Dom realized some psychic energy was flowing from his fallen opponents to him now that the combat was over. He'd have to talk to Kal and figure out what that was about later on. Dom turned to Micaela and softly asked, \"You ok?\" Staring at Dom wide eyed, she finally shrieked, \"YOU ATTACKED MY BROTHER!!\" \"If that's your family, your family sucks.\" That statement seemed to deflate her, and she sank down in her chair. A sense of finality and despair seemed to engulf her. After a few seconds, she whispered, \"They are going to take it out on me when you leave.\" Dom reached out and touched her where Malach back handed her. Pushing healing energy into her face, Dom replied, \"You are not alone. If you need friend, I'm staying at the old 'Higant' house on the lake.\" Then softly added, \"I don't have any friends, not like us.\" Dom smiled, turned, and walked out the store's front door. Awe and wonder dominated Micaela's face. She couldn't believe what just happened, with someone standing up to her brother. Standing up for her. Even more shocking, he was a healer. There hadn't been a healer since she could remember. It had to have been generations since the last healer. She didn't know what her clan would do. Would they seek revenge for Malach's beat down and humiliation? Or would they seek to tie him to the clan in some way as a healer? She had no clue. Hell, she didn't know what she wanted either. But Maybe. Hopefully. She had started to make a friend. She wasn't sure. She didn't have any friends either. Foolish. You let her know where we are staying. If she betrays us to her clan, they will come down on us in force. You do not have the power, nor the experience to survive an encounter like that. You've put yourself in danger unnecessarily. I thought of that. But... It WAS necessary. It was necessary for me, for my soul, for my mental well being. I needed to make sure I'm still going to do the right thing when everything else goes to shit. And if she doesn't tell anyone where we are, we'll know without a doubt she's trustworthy. That made it worth it. Not completely worth it. We didn't pick up the supplies and toiletries we initially went there for.

Damnit!!","title":"Chapter 3 - Pride &amp; Prejudice"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter4/","text":"Chapter 4 - Hunting Season [Location: Mount Elbert, Colorado] Shortly after the 'incident', as it was being referred to in Grand Lake, the Silversteels called for an emergency clan meet. The 5 largest clans and their affiliate branches all showed up to the Mount Elbert clan hall. Clan Silversteel, Clan Goldwing, Clan Brightblade, Clan Whitespear, and Clan Heartshield. The most powerful clans on the west coast of the United States. And as with any group of powerful people, they smiled, they nodded, and they barely held off killing each other. Eventually, they decided to just ignore each other. Joseph Silversteel, clan head and de facto Daimonic leader of North America, sat at a large round table, and brought the judge's gavel down on the wooden block before him. The conversations tapered off as Joseph politely waited, ready to lay out the problem for them to address. \"Elders, we have a problem that needs to be addressed,\" Joseph announced to the room. \"I don't think so. If this is about your son getting humiliated, then the problem you called us for, is not the problem. The problem is that you think YOUR problem is OUR problem,\" replied Seraphina Whitespear smugly. Joseph's head snapped to look at her and sneered, \"Of course that would be your reply, lacking courage to face an adversary seems to be a Whitespear trait.\" \"Why don't you explain to us WHY this affects us, Joseph. Looking at this from the outside, it appears to just be an internal issue to your people.\" replied Dara Heartshield, gently laying a placating hand on Seraphina's shoulder to stop her from launching across the table at the Silversteel clan head. \"Though this should be obvious to a real leader, there are several reasons for a unified response. First, the designated clan heir was viciously attacked, unprovoked no less. Unless you want your own heirs attacked unilaterally for some invisible perceived insult, a response is required. Secondly, by all accounts, this individual took out 3 future clan leaders with extensive combat experience very quickly, but didn't kill them. This could be an agent for some other group or power trying to destabilize ours. Or sow mistrust. Or they could be a terrorist. They need to be found and answer for their crimes. Therefore, I call for a Wild Hunt to be invoked against this individual.\" The remaining clan leaders were stunned by the request. \"There hasn't been a Wild Hunt in hundreds of years. It's usually invoked for murderers and betrayers! Not someone who smacks around arrogant little bullies,\" shouted Seraphina, trying to stop the madness of the clan leader's request. \"I disagree Seraphina, this individual needs to learn their place in the order of things,\" blurts Gabriel Brightblade. \"And this might be just the push some of our weaker members need to grow. I agree with Clan Silversteel, and I too call for the Wild Hunt.\" \"Do we even know where to find this individual? Is he still in this area?\", adds Dara reluctantly, seemingly shocked at this turn of events. \"It does not matter,\" booms Joseph triumphantly. \"The Hunt has been called. His fate is sealed.\" \"If there is no further business for the clans to discuss, we are dismissed.\" your sarcasm and sincerity sound awfully similar","title":"Chapter 4 - Hunting Season"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter4/#chapter-4-hunting-season","text":"[Location: Mount Elbert, Colorado] Shortly after the 'incident', as it was being referred to in Grand Lake, the Silversteels called for an emergency clan meet. The 5 largest clans and their affiliate branches all showed up to the Mount Elbert clan hall. Clan Silversteel, Clan Goldwing, Clan Brightblade, Clan Whitespear, and Clan Heartshield. The most powerful clans on the west coast of the United States. And as with any group of powerful people, they smiled, they nodded, and they barely held off killing each other. Eventually, they decided to just ignore each other. Joseph Silversteel, clan head and de facto Daimonic leader of North America, sat at a large round table, and brought the judge's gavel down on the wooden block before him. The conversations tapered off as Joseph politely waited, ready to lay out the problem for them to address. \"Elders, we have a problem that needs to be addressed,\" Joseph announced to the room. \"I don't think so. If this is about your son getting humiliated, then the problem you called us for, is not the problem. The problem is that you think YOUR problem is OUR problem,\" replied Seraphina Whitespear smugly. Joseph's head snapped to look at her and sneered, \"Of course that would be your reply, lacking courage to face an adversary seems to be a Whitespear trait.\" \"Why don't you explain to us WHY this affects us, Joseph. Looking at this from the outside, it appears to just be an internal issue to your people.\" replied Dara Heartshield, gently laying a placating hand on Seraphina's shoulder to stop her from launching across the table at the Silversteel clan head. \"Though this should be obvious to a real leader, there are several reasons for a unified response. First, the designated clan heir was viciously attacked, unprovoked no less. Unless you want your own heirs attacked unilaterally for some invisible perceived insult, a response is required.
