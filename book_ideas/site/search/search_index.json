Daemon is the Latin word for the Ancient Greek of daimon (\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd: \"god\", \"godlike\", \"power\", \"fate\"), which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit such as the daemons of ancient Greek religion and mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European daimon \"provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies), \" from the root da- \"to divide\". Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities, according to entry \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd at Liddell & Scott. Additionally, For reference, BCE is short for Before Common Era. The Common Era begins with year 1 in the Gregorian calendar and is also known as the Western or Christian calendar. The First \"Gods\" Generally the Oldest Deities are the Mesopotamian Gods. The seven sages in Sumerian mythology sent to the earth by Anu (or Enki in some stories) at the beginning of time to give human beings the sacred 'me' (laws) of civilization. They were also known, by the Akkadians and Babylonians, as The Apkallu or the Apkallu Fish and are depicted with the body of a fish and the head of a man or with the torso of a fish and human arms, legs and head, sometimes with and sometimes without wings. In the Babylonian tradition, the Apkallu also appear as Griffins or simply as humans with wings. There are shrines to Enki dating back to the founding of the city of Eridu, considered by the Mesopotamians the first city established at the beginning of the world c. 5400 BCE. None of the old Gods actually were divine though... Huh, then what were they really? Travelers from alternate dimensions and planes, space. More importantly, they were usually opportunists and unscrupulous businessmen and merchants. Just vasty overpowered compared to the native life here on Earth. Also for some of them, Earth also acted as a penal colony, similar to the origins of Australia. Power/Level Development Similar to Wuxia and Cultivation style with parts of software code development. Stages of Development (10 sub-stages within each development level): Progression info Stage 1: Body Primarily increasing body strength and development. Psychic and/or elemental abilities are very limited to usually single target with long cool down times (cannot be used again until refreshed). Stage 2: Mind Continuance of body refinement (Stage 1) for strength and agility, but a dramatic increase in inherent abilities. Psychic & Elemental abilities may begin to cover small groups and have increased potency as well as increased range and frequency. Most individuals are killed during this time. Wings emerge after the 5 th sub-stage. Stage 3: Spirit Continuance of mind refinement (Stage 2). Daimonic Armor begins to get revealed. Individuals with Daimon armor are greatly respected and feared for toughness (tend to be very old) Stage 4: Ascended Drawn to conflict Assembly of followers and aspects that would be considered 'Divine' Stage 5: Immortal Example : Rank 5 Body Refinement, Rank 2 Spirit Refiner Ability Development Progression info Stage 1: Body (Psychic Energy Manipulation gained) Healing Self, but not Healing Other until Rank 6 Body. At-will, dependant on energy pool. Shield / Warding can only be used 1x per day (per sub-stage level) Energy Drain (Psychic) can only be used 1x per week (per sub-stage level) Energy Drain (Life) can only be used 1x per month. Single Target only. Stage 2: Mind (Psychic Element Manipulation gained) All Psychic Energy Manipulation abilities, except Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Energy Drain (Life) can be used 1x per week (per sub-stage level). Single Target only. Special Limitation: The user must process & consolidate life energy gained within 24 hours or will catatonic for 48 hours Access to all Elemental types (ie. Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Darkness, Crystal, and Metal). Elemental type rank cooresponds to sub-stage level). User cannot progress to the next sub-stage level unless elemental proficiency at each sub-stage level is achieved. Stage 3: Spirit Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Single Target only. Daimonic Armor gained resistances to users Elemental affinities (5% resistance per sub-stage Level). Daimonic Weapons can channel a psychic ability (Dominick can channel Energy Drain (Life) through spear). Stage 4: Ascended Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Multiple targets, Grouping is now possible. This is perhaps the most feared ability and stage. Opposing Groups have been known to work together to destroy an Ascended Energy Drain (Life) user. Stage 5: Immortal Chapter Highlights Highlights Intro to hero, Dominick. Intro to normal life for hero. Witnessing the battle between Marshal and Violator. Dominick inherits responsibilities, tech equipment, and AI assistant, named Apkallu. \"AI\" in form of Necklace. Can change shape & form. Two Violators enter the hospital to seize the AI and kill Dominick Escape via Psychic Energy Manipulation activation by draining of one of the Violators as fuel. Energy Drain (Life). However, The use of Energy Drain (Life) causes additional conflicts. Some will believe It should not have been unlocked without binding oaths and punishments. The reason for the fear is that using Energy Drain (Life) and Energy Drain (Psychic) can add the target's skillset to the originators. Part of conflict caught on hospital internal security video feed, and police/feds involved. Intro to villain, Donal Ryan. Hunts other Daimons to equip those loyal to his faction. Mindset is psychopathic corporate raider. Targets other factions for tech and resources. Pulls hospital video surveillance videos. Starts to hunt Dominick. Wants to know, broker information and such. Seeks to learn how to create a daimon that is loyal/subservient to him. Dominick goes back home to visit family & friends. Discovers a previous girlfriend is also part-daimon (part of clan Draoi ). Small clan of elemental-type Daimon of Celtic background. Magoi (Wizard/Witch). Learns of the term 'Daimon' and it's meaning. Learns that his situation, while rare, is not unique. She helps him and helps him realize his potential, and that having a personal AI is overpowered for him. Also that he's potentially a type daimon. Learns Paladins are respected. Appear as Angelics, and most clans work with them as they tend to be fair and unbiased. Dominick learns there are whole communities of \"Daimons.\" Starts to train with Gwyneth Curran and her family. Speak to other Magoi (Wizard/Witch) clans. Offered job as a protector and guard. Major assault on trying to remove Draoi and Jingshen clans.

The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically. A lot was riding on this test run. His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent. They were a small, young team and every win counted. After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report. 15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl. You could have heard a pin drop. Application performing as expected for all tests. No errors found. Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around. The collective sigh of relief was palpable. Mary Galdur, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry. \"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer. First round is on me.\" Dominick said with a smile to the team. The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world. Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time. Hell, what's the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe. Dominick chuckled as he thought to myself, he thought, I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements to suppress his libido. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the \"Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment\", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls. The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, Dominick spotted his target. \"Good evening, Mr. Reagan Addison. How are you tonight?\" asked Dominick. \"Ah, Good evening to you, Dominick. We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight. Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?\" he coolly asked. He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it. \"Actually, we finished tonight. All tests passing, and all requirements met. Ahead of schedule too, I might add,\" replied Dominick. The soft smile continued. \"I wanted to bring you the good news in person. All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate.\" \"Outstanding news, Dom. This does call for a toast.\" A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across Reagan Addison's face. No man should be that pretty. The one time Dom stopped by his firm's office, he noticed that everyone, LITERALLY everyone, in that office was gorgeous. Like it was some sort of unspoken corporate requirement for them to be good looking as well as intelligent. Quite frankly, that was disheartening. Reagan Addison continues speaking, \"There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related. I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward. And Rich.\" My first thought is, \"It's not about the money.\" But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, \"When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money.\" Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like? \"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. Reagan Addison. I'm going to meet up with the rest of my coworkers to try to salvage the rest of my ni-\" An quick series of loud and bright explosions ripples out from the main entrance. There's not that much the way in damage, but the flash of temporary blindness and sharp ringing in our ears is a testament that something has gone catastrophically bad. \"GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR DIE!\" is heard loud and clear, repeated over and over to various huddled groups. This is quickly followed by the sounds of automatic gunfire. Dominick remained strangely calm throughout all this, and was quickly and smoothly getting down on the floor, as the robbery crew asked. But that's not what caught Dom's eye and held his attention. As Reagan Addison turned to face them, Dom swore he saw a silver-bluish aura surround Reagan Addison's form. Rage and Anger flashed in his eyes and a primal scream tore out of his throat. Reagan Addison charged his attackers, and they turned and fired upon him. It must have been the shock and confusion of the moment, because it appeared that none of the bullets fired seemed to hit Reagan Addison before he was upon them. And then it got ugly. I did't want to stare, but I just couldn't look away. Reagan Addison was breaking arms, and crushing faces. One of the rifleman literally had an indentation in his skull from a punch. I didn't know whether to cheer or throw up it was so vicious. And just when I thought it couldn't get more surreal, two other individuals slowly stalked into the room and it was like a bad horror movie come to life. One looked something like an armored version of Michael Myers, with his porcelain mask actually in a sneer and a blood-encrusted hand axe. The other was a god-damned werewolf, so lifelike I thought it had to be some sort of theme-park animatronic. But it was far too real and graceful for that. I don't think my psyche accepted what I was seeing. I'll never forget the first thought to run through my head on seeing them walk into the room. This is ridiculous. I'm never going to a museum again. Reagan Addison looked at the newcomers with wild eyes and a pronouced sense of bloodlust, breathing heavier and heavier each passing second; and then he just charged them. The werewolf moved to intercept him and the Mike Myers character skirted around the side, appearing to flank him. 2 versus 1 is not good odds any day of the week, in any situation. Add to that, that one of the robbers was wielding an axe and the one individual we had on our side seemed to be out of his mind with rage, things looked rather grim. It was time to look for an exit strategy. Or as I've been routinely texted, from my development staff for staying late in the office, \"GTFO Dom\". Thankfully, Dominick was not the only person to realize it was time to 'Get the Hell out of Dodge'. The entire situation, however was a front-and-center, in-your-face, live rendition of 'Trainwreck TV' though. Reagan Addison and the Werewolf were locked together hand-to-hand and pushing each other around, crashing into the walls and various stone motifs on the museum floor. Violently and explosively crashing into them. Reagan Addison was holding his own though, Dominick would give him that. The werewolf's ax-wielding murder partner couldn't get close to them yet, as Reagan Addison used the werewolf as a shield, the couple of times he moved in. As such, the Mike Myers halloween junkie was waiting patiently for his opportunity to make his strike. It looked like it was just a matter of time at this point. With all of the focus on the close combat contestants, some of the museum patrons realized they were being ignored, and started to get up and make a run for the exits. Some of were uninjured, some were in shock, and others were bleeding from shrapnel or some other type of injury. It was pure pandemonium. And still, Dominick watched these combatants fling each other around and try to kill each other. Something kept him locked in place though, he wasn't afraid per se but he was looking at the fight in a more analytical view, more studious, almost.... judgmental. Just then, they crashed into a huge stone relief of one of the winged 'Annunaki', which was one of the ancient Mesopotamian gods. Stone chunks were flung around the room, and priceless artifacts instantly became dust and debris. A haze of dust and smoke was starting to fill the room, and Dominick heard a light chime, like some metal or crystal near the floor coming his way. Catching his eye as it slid toward him, was a large sapphire gem of the deepest royal blue he'd ever seen. Another crash resounded around the room, more violent than the last, and Dominick knew he needed to move now. As he moved to get up and turned for the side emergency fire exit, he reached out and grabbed the gem. A mild electric shock traveled up his arm and stopped his movements. But that wasn't what had him locked in place and blinking furiously. He was clearly hearing words that he should NOT be hearing. Trace biological patterns and mitochondrial DNA confirm ancestry to the required bloodline profile. Initiating molecular bonding of Daimonic AI now... What. The Hell. Is going on? Another roar echoed from the combatants, and this time, without looking back, Dominick moved and continued his escape out the museum. Presumptively, he thought, Thank God I drive a tank. The scene outside the museum was what you'd expect it to be. One expensive localized disaster. In some ways, it resembled someone kicking over an ant hill. Well-dressed patrons, donors, museum staff, and clueless bystanders, all running and hustling in multiple directions at once. The sound of police sirens and fire engines could now be heard off in the background but steadily gaining strength and closing the distance. Dom pulled out his keys, turned the car alarm off, and jumped in his truck. The adrenaline from the escape was now starting to come down and exhaustion was creeping in. Turning the truck on, and running his hands through his hair, he started to prioritize. OK, Get home, Food and Hot shower, before I start to really freak out. Dom pulled onto the main street and sped away from the downtown scene as fast as he could. He didn't care about speeding or getting a ticket. It appeared that all the attention was focused behind him, with every emergency service vehicle moving in that direction. He turned onto Interstate I-95, and started driving northbound, driving virtually on auto-pilot to get home as fast as possible. After a while, numb, and unaware of how much time had passed, he finally walked in the door of his home, and the events of that evening started to replay in his mind. Grabbing some Nature Valley and pemmican bars he kept for hiking out of the pantry, he tore into them, sat down and thought on all that had happened tonight. This is crazy. Who were those guys? What did they want? And... hey, wait a minute, what the hell happened to that gem I grabbed? Daimonic AI bonding complete. DNA restructuring and gene therapy commencing now... Pain wracked through his entire body. Everything felt as if it was on fire. His stomach violently twisted and he felt as if he was going to retch, throwing up his stomach contents. But a smooth deep voice dominated this mind. Hello Dominick. I hope you prove worthy... What ... And Dom slipped into oblivion.","title":"Chapter 1 - The Awakening"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter1/#chapter-1-the-awakening","text":"[Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL] Dominick watched the testing framework run. The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically. A lot was riding on this test run. His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent. They were a small, young team and every win counted. After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report. 15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl. You could have heard a pin drop. Application performing as expected for all tests. No errors found. Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around. The collective sigh of relief was palpable. Mary Galdur, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry. \"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer. First round is on me.\" Dominick said with a smile to the team. The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world. Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time. Hell, what's the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe. Dominick chuckled as he thought to myself, he thought, I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements to suppress his libido. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named the \"Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment\", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls. The people there were standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. Finally, Dominick spotted his target. \"Good evening, Mr. Reagan Addison. How are you tonight?\" asked Dominick. \"Ah, Good evening to you, Dominick. We did not expect you to make an appearance tonight. Can I assume by your smile and relaxed mien, that things are going well regarding the project?\" he coolly asked. He sipped on some sort of alcoholic drink, probably a very expensive scotch by the looks and aroma coming off of it. \"Actually, we finished tonight. All tests passing, and all requirements met. Ahead of schedule too, I might add,\" replied Dominick. The soft smile continued. \"I wanted to bring you the good news in person. All results have been sent to your Board of Directors as well, per your mandate.\" \"Outstanding news, Dom. This does call for a toast.\" A 100 mega-watt smile spreads across Reagan Addison's face. No man should be that pretty. The one time Dom stopped by his firm's office, he noticed that everyone, LITERALLY everyone, in that office was gorgeous. Like it was some sort of unspoken corporate requirement for them to be good looking as well as intelligent. Quite frankly, that was disheartening. Reagan Addison continues speaking, \"There were several Board members and their families watching this very closely, for personal reasons as well as business related. I suspect your firm will be ridiculously busy going forward. And Rich.\" My first thought is, \"It's not about the money.\" But then, I'm reminded of another ancillary quote, \"When someone says 'It's not the money, it's the principle,' nine times out of ten, it's the money.\" Huh...I wonder what NOT having a truck payment is like? \"I'm sure my team will be glad to hear that Mr. Reagan Addison.

Ravenously hungry and de-hydrated, he began to pick himself up off the floor. He climbed back up on the couch, and grabbed the water bottle he picked up earlier and chugged it completely. After a few seconds, he needed more. Moving to the kitchen, he re-filled the water bottle from the fridge's water dispenser, and chugged that too. Careful. You want to make sure you keep that in your system. Smaller sips would prove more beneficial. Who am I hearing? Oh Crap, Am I going crazy? No, you are not having a psychotic episode. You do remember the bonding announcement, correct? Sort of. You sure I'm not crazy? Yes I'm sure. I am an artificial entity created for the purpose of teaching the descendants of Enki about their heritage and unlocking their potential. Most of the bloodline were hidden for years, even when Enki and his brother were still here, because too many others feared their power. Enki was a little... vigorous when it came to having kids. So, what's my potential? Well, I mean, my mom always said that my potential was hidden deep down and you won't really know your potential unless you push yourself in the face of adversity. Your mother was absolutely correct. Ugh. Oh goody. Just... don't tell her that, OK? I'll never hear the end of it. So, the hunger and dehydration are side effects of some of the genetic modifications that are still ongoing, though most of it is done. You have been unconscious for approximately 24 hours. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME??!! I've unlocked your daimonic progression levels. We will be training to increase your body's power, strength, coordination, and endurance, as well as focusing your mental acuity on both psychic energy and elemental manipulation. Um... Demonic progression.... Incorrect. DAIMONIC. From the ancient Greek '\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd', which meant 'godlike, power or fate'. Daimons were seen as lesser deities or guiding spirits and could be either good or evil. Or both. Depending on their attitude. OK, we'll be training. Um, why do we need to train? And what about the mental focusing something...? Correct. We train so you are not killed by other Daimonic individual who are afraid of you. Or what you will become. I mentioned this earlier? Regardless, the mental aspects are the Psychic Energy and Elemental Manipulation skills. So I have magic or something now? No, you have the ability to psychically interact with various Nanites that have been injected into your bloodstream. The nanites are what's used for the DNA restructuring, as well as manipulating various energy frequencies. Your body and system are creating more and more nanites as we speak. That is some of the replication that is still ongoing. And will be for some time. Oh. OK. Um, how many progression levels are there? There are 5 established and recognized progression or refinement levels, with approximately 10 sub-stages per level. These are Body, Mind, Spirit, Ascended, and Immortal, but it is unlikely you will reach the pinnacle in levels. Too many outside variables and hostile actors and forces will try to prevent this from happening, but the first 3 levels should be very doable for you. Especially with myself acting as a guide. You should become quite powerful, if we are given the opportunity. And you aren't killed. You're just a bundle of sunshine, aren't you? Hey, what do I call you? My name is Apkallu. After a long shower and a double-portioned breakfast, Dom called his office and asked to speak with Mary. He figured no matter what the situation was or what happened to him, as long as he was ok, she'd want to make sure he was ok and everything. \"Mary here, Dom, is that you? You OK?\" \"Hey Mary, I'm good, not hurt. Just... really messed up mentally on what happened the other night. I crashed unbelievably hard. I think my body needed it. Sorry I didn't contact you sooner. I think I just needed time. ...Still do if I'm being honest,\" Dom replied with a heavy sigh. \"I'll let everyone here know you're ok. We're glad you're not hurt, Dom. Are you gonna go talk to a therapist or something? I know I would need one.\" \"You just like to talk to people. ...Actually Mary, I think I'm gonna take a break for a bit. I saw some things that I'm having a hard time with. I think I'm gonna take a leave of absence. Take some time for myself. Clear some things up.\" Dom paused. \"The application should be good to go, and I'm leaving the rest of it in your hands. You're in charge, Mary. I'll send an email or something to that effect so our staff and clients know.\" \"No worries Dom. Just remember how much I took care of you during my performance review.\" \"Oh you're getting a nice fat raise, Mary. I'll email payroll right after this call to make it official as well.\" \"Take care of yourself Dom, and call us if you need anything.\" After an extended pause, \"I, um, might have family that understands some of what you're going through, if you need a non-medical person to speak to.\" \"I doubt it Mary, but thanks for looking out for me. Call you soon.\" Dominick hung up. Apkallu, you there? I will always be here Dom. How can I help you? We discussed training. What do we need to do? What's the plan? DO YOU... have a plan? First, since there are other Daimons actively hunting in this area, we should go somewhere remote, more isolated than here, so we are not discovered. Do you have a location for this? Maybe... We used to have a time-share near Grand Lake, Colorado. It's really nice and quiet, very private but expensive to stay there. That is not a problem. Once we have enough control over our elemental manipulation and have sufficient energy reserves to start converting base metals, most of our issues should be resolved very quickly. At least financially. Wait, you mean, like a Philosopher's stone and stuff...? You mean like converting Lead into Gold? Yes. Or Palladium, or Rhodium, or anything really. Although inert transition metals are easier to convert. Less taxing energy wise. But that's going to take a couple of weeks to get there. OK, I can do this. I'll call and book the house now. Nobody is there this time of year. Too cold during the winter. Also, I suggest driving there. It gives us more options, allows for us to hide, if we are discovered. Being stuck in a flying tube does not seem particularly safe to me.","title":"Chapter 2 - AI Introduction"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapters/chapter2/#chapter-2-ai-introduction","text":"Sometime later, Dom woke.

Although inert transition metals are easier to convert. Less taxing energy wise. But that's going to take a couple of weeks to get there. OK, I can do this. I'll call and book the house now. Nobody is there this time of year. Too cold during the winter. Also, I suggest driving there. It gives us more options, allows for us to hide, if we are discovered. Being stuck in a flying tube does not seem particularly safe to me.","title":"Chapter 2 - AI Introduction"}]}
