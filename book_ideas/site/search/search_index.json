Daniel Schinhofen 2 The American writer Daniel Schinhofen is an extremely well regarded author within his particular field, largely concerning himself with gaming in fiction. This is where literature role-playing games, or LITRPG as it\u2019s more commonly known, comes in, making for an interactive reading experience for his audience. Michael Anderle 3 Michael Anderle is a noteworthy author hailing from America, who is famous for writing science fiction, paranormal, and fantasy books.

All this has helped secure him a place as a New York Times best-selling author.

Daemon is the Latin word for the Ancient Greek of daimon (\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd: \"god\", \"godlike\", \"power\", \"fate\"), which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit such as the daemons of ancient Greek religion and mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European daimon \"provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies), \" from the root da- \"to divide\". Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities, according to entry \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd at Liddell & Scott. Additionally, For reference, BCE is short for Before Common Era. The Common Era begins with year 1 in the Gregorian calendar and is also known as the Western or Christian calendar. The First \"Gods\" Generally the Oldest Deities are the Mesopotamian Gods. The seven sages in Sumerian mythology sent to the earth by Enki at the beginning of time to give human beings the sacred 'me' (laws) of civilization. They were also known, by the Akkadians and Babylonians, as The Apkallu or the Apkallu Fish and are depicted with the body of a fish and the head of a man or with the torso of a fish and human arms, legs and head, sometimes with and sometimes without wings. In the Babylonian tradition, the Apkallu also appear as Griffins or simply as humans with wings. There are shrines to Enki dating back to the founding of the city of Eridu, considered by the Mesopotamians the first city established at the beginning of the world c. 5400 BCE. None of the old Gods actually were divine though... Huh, then what were they really? Travelers from alternate dimensions and planes, space. More importantly, they were usually opportunists and unscrupulous businessmen and merchants. Just vasty overpowered compared to the native life here on Earth. Also for some of them, Earth also acted as a penal colony, similar to the origins of Australia. Power/Level Development Similar to Wuxia and Cultivation style with parts of software code development. Stages of Development (10 sub-stages within each development level): Progression info Stage 1: Body Primarily increasing body strength and development. Psychic and/or elemental abilities are very limited to usually single target with long cool down times (cannot be used again until refreshed). Stage 2: Mind Continuance of body refinement (Stage 1) for strength and agility, but a dramatic increase in inherent abilities. Psychic & Elemental abilities may begin to cover small groups and have increased potency as well as increased range and frequency. Most individuals are killed during this time. Wings emerge after the 5 th sub-stage. Stage 3: Spirit Continuance of mind refinement (Stage 2). Daimonic Armor begins to get revealed. Individuals with Daimon armor are greatly respected and feared for toughness (tend to be very old) Stage 4: Ascended Drawn to conflict Assembly of followers and aspects that would be considered 'Divine' Stage 5: Immortal Example : Rank 5 Body Refinement, Rank 2 Spirit Refiner Ability Development Progression info Stage 1: Body (Psychic Energy Manipulation gained) Healing Self, but not Healing Other until Rank 6 Body. At-will, dependant on energy pool. Shield can only be used 1x per day (per sub-stage level) Energy Drain (Psychic) can only be used 1x per week (per sub-stage level) Energy Drain (Life) can only be used 1x per month. Single Target only. Stage 2: Mind (Psychic Element Manipulation gained) All Psychic Energy Manipulation abilities, except Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Energy Drain (Life) can be used 1x per week (per sub-stage level). Single Target only. Special Limitation: The user must process & consolidate life energy gained within 24 hours or will catatonic for 48 hours Access to all Elemental types (ie. Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Darkness, Smoke, Crystal, and Metal). Elemental type rank cooresponds to sub-stage level). User cannot progress to the next sub-stage level unless elemental proficiency at each sub-stage level is achieved. Stage 3: Spirit Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Single Target only. Daimonic Armor gained resistances to users Elemental affinities (5% resistance per sub-stage Level). Daimonic Weapons can channel a psychic ability (Easton can channel Energy Drain (Life) through spear). Stage 4: Ascended Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Multiple targets, Grouping is now possible. This is perhaps the most feared ability and stage. Opposing Groups have been known to work together to destroy an Ascended Energy Drain (Life) user.
