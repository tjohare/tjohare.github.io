Arand 1 William D Arand is a GameLit author best known for his unique stories. The talented author holds a day job that takes care of his bills and only writes in his free time. However, he has managed to create an impressive readership, and currently, he has over 20 published works to his name. Daniel Schinhofen 2 The American writer Daniel Schinhofen is an extremely well regarded author within his particular field, largely concerning himself with gaming in fiction. This is where literature role-playing games, or LITRPG as it\u2019s more commonly known, comes in, making for an interactive reading experience for his audience. Michael Anderle 3 Michael Anderle is a noteworthy author hailing from America, who is famous for writing science fiction, paranormal, and fantasy books. He is particularly well known for writing and publishing the Kurtherian Gambit book series. Author Anderle was born in the year 1967 in Houston, Texas. Jim Butcher 4 Well known fantasy author Jim Butcher is highly regarded thanks to his popular series of novels \u2018The Dresden Files\u2019 as well as the \u2018Codex Alera\u2019 saga. All this has helped secure him a place as a New York Times best-selling author. What type of Protagonist & Situation Pure Magical This character has gained some degree of magical ability or knowledge, outside of the norm for current reality. Pseudo-Magical (via Technology) A technology-based ability that's appears so advanced that an outsider would mistakenly conclude it could be magically based. ie.

Daemon is the Latin word for the Ancient Greek of daimon (\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd: \"god\", \"godlike\", \"power\", \"fate\"), which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit such as the daemons of ancient Greek religion and mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European daimon \"provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies), \" from the root da- \"to divide\". Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities, according to entry \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd at Liddell & Scott. Additionally, For reference, BCE is short for Before Common Era. The Common Era begins with year 1 in the Gregorian calendar and is also known as the Western or Christian calendar. The First \"Gods\" Generally the Oldest Deities are the Mesopotamian Gods. The seven sages in Sumerian mythology sent to the earth by Enki at the beginning of time to give human beings the sacred 'me' (laws) of civilization. They were also known, by the Akkadians and Babylonians, as The Apkallu or the Apkallu Fish and are depicted with the body of a fish and the head of a man or with the torso of a fish and human arms, legs and head, sometimes with and sometimes without wings. In the Babylonian tradition, the Apkallu also appear as Griffins or simply as humans with wings. There are shrines to Enki dating back to the founding of the city of Eridu, considered by the Mesopotamians the first city established at the beginning of the world c. 5400 BCE. None of the old Gods actually were divine though... Huh, then what were they really? Travelers from alternate dimensions and planes, space. More importantly, they were usually opportunists and unscrupulous businessmen and merchants. Just vasty overpowered compared to the native life here on Earth. Also for some of them, Earth also acted as a penal colony, similar to the origins of Australia. Power/Level Development Similar to Wuxia and Cultivation style with parts of software code development. Stages of Development (10 sub-stages within each development level): Progression info Stage 1: Body Primarily increasing body strength and development. Psychic and/or elemental abilities are very limited to usually single target with long cool down times (cannot be used again until refreshed). Stage 2: Mind Continuance of body refinement (Stage 1) for strength and agility, but a dramatic increase in inherent abilities. Psychic & Elemental abilities may begin to cover small groups and have increased potency as well as increased range and frequency. Most individuals are killed during this time. Wings emerge after the 5 th sub-stage. Stage 3: Spirit Continuance of mind refinement (Stage 2). Daimonic Armor begins to get revealed. Individuals with Daimon armor are greatly respected and feared for toughness (tend to be very old) Stage 4: Ascended Drawn to conflict Assembly of followers and aspects that would be considered 'Divine' Stage 5: Immortal Example : Rank 5 Body Refinement, Rank 2 Spirit Refiner Ability Development Progression info Stage 1: Body (Psychic Energy Manipulation gained) Healing Self, but not Healing Other until Rank 6 Body. At-will, dependant on energy pool. Shield can only be used 1x per day (per sub-stage level) Energy Drain (Psychic) can only be used 1x per week (per sub-stage level) Energy Drain (Life) can only be used 1x per month. Single Target only. Stage 2: Mind (Psychic Element Manipulation gained) All Psychic Energy Manipulation abilities, except Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Energy Drain (Life) can be used 1x per week (per sub-stage level). Single Target only. Special Limitation: The user must process & consolidate life energy gained within 24 hours or will catatonic for 48 hours Access to all Elemental types (ie. Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Light, Darkness, Smoke, Crystal, and Metal). Elemental type rank cooresponds to sub-stage level). User cannot progress to the next sub-stage level unless elemental proficiency at each sub-stage level is achieved. Stage 3: Spirit Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Single Target only. Daimonic Armor gained resistances to users Elemental affinities (5% resistance per sub-stage Level). Daimonic Weapons can channel a psychic ability (Dominick can channel Energy Drain (Life) through spear). Stage 4: Ascended Energy Drain (Life) can be used At-will, dependant on energy pool. Multiple targets, Grouping is now possible. This is perhaps the most feared ability and stage. Opposing Groups have been known to work together to destroy an Ascended Energy Drain (Life) user.

The web page after web page were filled out, changed, deleted, and submitted quickly and methodically. A lot was riding on this test run. His development team worked on and coded this security application for over a year, and the team was counting on a big win and future requests from the client to stay solvent. They were a small, young team and every win counted. After about 20-minutes, it stopped and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) spit out its report. 15 people crowded around the office monitors, watching the framework run as if it was the last-second, Hail-Mary pass of the Super Bowl. You could have heard a pin drop. Application performing as expected for all tests. No errors found. Quiet cheers, a couple of high-fives, and smiles were given all around. The collective sigh of relief was palpable. Mary Addison, the lead developer and one of my good friends specifically recruited for this effort, actually started to cry. \"OK folks, lets get this code locked down, checked in, and sent out to the customer. First round is on me.\" Dominick said with a smile to the team. The new security application was going to one of the biggest insurance companies in the western hemisphere, and their large client list included some of the most influential antiquities museums and dealers around the world. Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time , he thought. Hell, what was the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe, I thought to myself. I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements. Random Obscure Fact, Chaste tree berry was also known as \"Monk's pepper\" and was used to dampen libido 1 in the Middle Ages. Don't ask me why I know that or even remember it, I just do. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named \" Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment \", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls. The people there was standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. https://eunatural.com/is-vitex-really-an-anaphrodisiac/ \u21a9","title":"Chapter 1"},{"location":"books/daimonic/chapter1/#chapter-1","text":"Dominick watched the testing framework run.

Securing the contract was an unexpected surprise and rightly seen as a major coup, especially for a newly formed software development firm. However, if they failured to deliver, it would have utterly doomed them. \"No pressure then\" was a re-occurring office catch phrase. About six months ago, the number of robberies of high-end art galleries and museums began to steadily increase, as well as get increasingly violent. Naturally, an increase in security, in both physical and electronic software, was expected. The security application that Dominick's team came up with, was ground breaking. An advanced heuristics driven method where the system learned what was considered secure and expected, and came up with increasing complex ways of rapidly verifying that information was correct, in case of either internal or external tampering. A lot of talk of AI was being thrown around. Quite a few institutions were closely monitoring the situation and interested how things turned out. Coincidentally, the client project manager was sponsoring one of the local museums, the Museum Of Discovery and Science, to host a small, private showing of ancient Greek and Mesopotamian artifacts for some high-end potential donors, critics, and philanthropists to help recoup development costs. \"Dominick Higant\" was on the guest list as a courtesy, but the priority was getting the project done first and he wasn't really expected or required to show up. Now though, he thought, maybe a quick stop off to let the client know that the project was finished was in order. Damn, I'll have to grab my coat though. Meh, I've got time , he thought. Hell, what was the worst that could happen? Driving a big F-150 truck may not scream wealth, but for Dominick, the comfort of driving a luxury \"tank\" always relaxed him. He parked across the street from the Museum Of Discovery and Science, and to be honest, he wasn't going to stay that long, so he didn't want the valet guys to do extra work. A little \"pat on the back\" session from the client, grab some kudos for his team, and make a less than graceful exit from the \"hoity-toity\" of society. One thing was abundantly clear, Dominick did not fit in with \"it\" crowd. Hell, the shoes of some of these people were more than his apartment's first-last-and-security deposit. \"The Vendor and Contractor entrance is in the rear loading dock area,\" said a smug-sounding security guard as Dominick approached the front entrance. \"Funny. You can check for my name on the list though. 'Dominick Higant'. You DO... know how to read, yes?\" Dominick said with a false smile and laughing eyes. \"Huh, it's on the list. Congrats on being more than a '+1'. Have a good night, sir,\" the guard smugly replied. Wow, What a douche canoe, I thought to myself. I shouldn't be too hard on him though... maybe I can get him a new forehead or some chaste tree berry supplements. Random Obscure Fact, Chaste tree berry was also known as \"Monk's pepper\" and was used to dampen libido 1 in the Middle Ages. Don't ask me why I know that or even remember it, I just do. I started to work my way through the light crowd and museum layout, looking for Reagan Addison, the project manager for the insurance firm and my primary contact on our security application, lovingly named \" Automated Security Heuristics Learning Environment \", or ASHLE for short. The lights inside the museum were dimmed and gentle spotlights showcased some tablet or ceramic pedastal near the walls. The people there was standing around, some looking at the various pieces and artifacts, others just waiting to be seen and noticed. Most had a glass of wine or champagne in the hands, and the gentle murmurs provided a constant buzzing. It was more social than educational with this crowd. https://eunatural.com/is-vitex-really-an-anaphrodisiac/ \u21a9","title":"Chapter 1"}]}
