To address this, we have adopted a minimalistic common error formats for our applications, with elements taken from RFC 7807 . API Error JSON Response Here at Creative Drive, we are using a very simple customized JSON Error response for our APIs. Additionally, For the sake of completeness, also included is the RFC-defined specification for handling error responses. Our Error-defined response { errors : [ { message : Incorrect email or password , code : 401 } ] } errors is the Json object type, followed by an Json Array which contains the error details object. message is the details of the error. This would correspond to the detail section of RFC 7807 . code is the status code that has been returned. The Content-type for all API responses (successful and error alike) is: Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json; The RFC-defined response The \"Official\" RFC-defined JSON Error response looks like thus: HTTP/ 1.1 403 Forbidden Content-Type: application/problem+json Content-Language: en { type : https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit , title : You do not have enough credit. , detail : Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50. , instance : /account/12345/msgs/abc , balance : 30 , accounts : [ /account/12345 , /account/67890 ] } A JSON Error object can have the following members: \"status\" (number) - The HTTP status code ( RFC 7231 , Section 6) generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.

This is commonly referred to as CRUD. These stand for: Create Retrieve/Read Update Delete/Destroy use POST for Create operations Use POST APIs to create new subordinate resources, e.g. a file is subordinate to a directory containing it or a row is subordinate to a database table. Talking strictly in terms of REST, POST methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources. Ideally, if a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be HTTP response code 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header. Many times, the action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either HTTP response code 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status. Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. Please note that POST is neither safe nor idempotent and invoking two identical POST requests will result in two different resources containing the same information (except resource ids). use GET for Retrieve operations Use GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only \u2013 and not to modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods. Additionally, GET APIs should be idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time until another API (POST or PUT) has changed the state of the resource on the server. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. For any given HTTP GET API, if the resource is found on the server then it must return HTTP response code 200 (OK) \u2013 along with response body which is usually either XML or JSON content (due to their platform independent nature). In case resource is NOT found on server then it must return HTTP response code 404 (NOT FOUND). Similarly, if it is determined that GET request itself is not correctly formed then server will return HTTP response code 400 (BAD REQUEST). use PUT for Update operations Use PUT APIs primarily to update existing resource (if the resource does not exist then API may decide to create a new resource or not). If a new resource has been created by the PUT API, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the HTTP response code 201 (Created) response and if an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request. If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable. The difference between the POST and PUT APIs can be observed in request URIs. POST requests are made on resource collections whereas PUT requests are made on an individual resource. PATCH Method not used The PATCH method, which is normally used for partial updates, is not used at this time for API development use DELETE for Delete operations As the name applies, DELETE APIs are used to delete resources (identified by the Request-URI). A successful response of DELETE requests SHOULD be HTTP response code 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has been queued, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been performed but the response does not include an entity. DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it\u2019s removed from the collection of resource. Repeatedly calling DELETE API on that resource will not change the outcome \u2013 however calling DELETE on a resource a second time will return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed. Some may argue that it makes DELETE method non-idempotent. It\u2019s a matter of discussion and personal opinion.

There should be no new set of APIs to handle these actions. To achieve this, we need to append the query params with the GET method API. Let\u2019s understand with few examples how to implement these actions. Operation Types Sorting In case, the client wants to get the sorted list of companies, the GET /companies endpoint should accept multiple sort params in the query. E.g GET /companies?sort=rank_asc would sort the companies by its rank in ascending order. Filtering For filtering the dataset, we can pass various options through query params. E.g GET /companies?category=banking location=india would filter the companies list data with the company category of Banking and where the location is India. Searching When searching the company name in companies list the API endpoint should be GET /companies?search=Digital Mckinsey Pagination When the dataset is too large, we divide the data set into smaller chunks, which helps in improving the performance and is easier to handle the response. Eg. GET /companies?page=23 means get the list of companies on 23 rd page. Output and Meta sections All output shall be returned in JSON:API format Whenever an endpoint allows for optional and complex parameters, you need to include a meta section in the JSON response of the API.

As such, you should refer to them in the PLURAL sense, such as /assets not /asset Good Collection Name example /divisions /divisions/1 /divisions/1/assets Poor Collection Name example /division /division/1 /division/1/asset 2 URLS per resource Use 1 URL for the collection itself, and 1 URL for a single resource within that collection Example //URL that represents a collection of resources GET / api / v1 / divisions //URL that represents a single resource GET / api / v1 / divisions / 5 Use NOUNS instead of Verbs for Resources Keeps the number of URLs low and much simpler.

While technically correct, they do not offer insight as to why the request failed and leads to longer debugging times and effort. It is generally accepted universally to keep the set of status codes small but providing the correct response allows developers to follow the process easier. Please refer to the HTTP Status Codes section for example. Provide Descriptive Error Messages, no contractions This one goes with the rule above, as you should provide a useful and VERBOSE description of the error Verbose Message example // example of a 400 Bad Request { errors : [ { status : 400 , message : Invalid state. Valid values are internal or external } ] } Please also note that you SHOULD NOT use contractions, like can't or couldn't , within an error message CamelCase for Attributes Use CamelCase for your attributes identifiers, starting with lowercase, such as { yearOfBirth : 1982 } Don\u2019t use underscores (year_of_birth) or capitalize (YearOfBirth). Often your RESTful web service will be consumed by a client written in JavaScript. Typically the client will convert the JSON response to a JavaScript object (by calling var person = JSON.parse(response) ) and call its attributes. Therefore, it\u2019s a good idea to stick to the JavaScript convention which makes the JavaScript code more readable and intuitive. Good example of Attributes CamelCase conventions // Do person.yearOfBirth Bad example of Attributes CamelCase conventions // Don't person.year_of_birth // violates JavaScript convention person.YearOfBirth // suggests constructor method Meta Data section at TOP of responses Whenever optional query parameters are included in an API, a META section is required in the response output.

Resource Resource is an object or entity that has a URI where it can be manipulated through HTTP requests. The resources has some associated data with it and there can be set of methods to operate on it. Collections Collections are set of resources grouped together. In many ways, think of collections as the table in a database. If you typed Select * from divisions you'd get all the divisions. In that same paradigm, a REST API call to GET /api/v1/divisions returns all the divisions Endpoint Endpoint is the URI that goes after the base URL and points towards the requested API functionality. Method Method is the part of an HTTP request that tells the server what the client wants to do. E.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH Status Code Status Code is the HTTP status codes are what the server sends in the response back to the client with regards to the status of the request.","title":"Terminologies"},{"location":"versioning/","text":"API Versioning You may end up in situations where the above approaches don\u2019t work and you really have to provide different versions of your API.
