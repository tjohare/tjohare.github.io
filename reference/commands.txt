Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog.
  jekyll new myblog
  Change into your new directory.
    cd myblog
  Build the site and make it available on a local server.
    bundle exec jekyll serve
  Browse to http://localhost:4000
  Pass the --livereload option to serve to automatically refresh the page with each change you make to the source files:
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

Remote theme method
  Remote themes are similar to Gem-based themes, but do not require Gemfile changes or whitelisting making them ideal for sites hosted with GitHub Pages.

  To install:

  Create/replace the contents of your Gemfile with the following:

  source "https://rubygems.org"

  gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
  gem "jekyll-include-cache", group: :jekyll_plugins
  Add jekyll-include-cache to the plugins array of your _config.yml.

  Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following Bundler command:

  bundle
  Add remote_theme: "mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.24.0" to your _config.yml file. Remove any other theme: or remote_theme: entry.
