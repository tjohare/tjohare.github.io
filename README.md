## Rest Api Standards
RESTful APIs are interfaces that enable applications to communicate with each other. The role of REST APIs has expanded dramatically, where even major companies, such as Facebook, Google, Github, Netflix and a few other tech giants have given access to developers and products to consume their data through APIs, and even became a platform for them. They can be used as an interface to the business, allowing them to monetize digital assets, extend their value proposition with partner-delivered capabilities, and connect to customers across multiple channels, tools, and devices.
